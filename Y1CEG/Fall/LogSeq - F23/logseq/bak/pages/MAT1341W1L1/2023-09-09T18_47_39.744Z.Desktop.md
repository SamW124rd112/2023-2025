- Let ℝ be a set of real numbers that can be represented on a line called a ^^real line^^

- '$$\mathbb{R^2}$$ represents the 2-D Plane
	- A point in $$\mathbb{R^2}$$ is represented by 2 coordinates like $$(a,b)$$ where $$a,b \in ℝ$$

- $$\mathbb{R^2}$$ is the 3-D space
	- Represented by $$(a,b,c)$$ where $$a,b,c \in ℝ $$

- Magnitude or length of a vector is defined by

- For any integer $$ n \ge 1$$ we have "$$n$$-space" denoted by $$\mathbb{R^n}$$
- An element is represent by $$(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)$$
- Sometimes $$\vec{u}$$ is used to emphasize the vector has direction
- ### Special Elements
- We always have zero vector (null vector) $$\vec{0} = (0, 0, ... , 0)$$
	- In $$\mathbb{R^2}$$ we have $$\hat{i} = (1,0) , \hat{j} = (0,1)$$
	- In $$\mathbb{R^3}$$ we have $$\hat{i} = (1,0,0) , \hat{j} = (0,1,0), \hat{k} = (0,0,1)$$
- Notation ^ means unit vector, i.e. length of vector is 1
- We write $$x = (x_1,... x_n)$$ to represent a vector going from $$(0, 0, ... 0)$$
- Also notation
	- $$u = (x_1, ... x_n) =  \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix} = [x_1, ..., x_n]^T $$
	- ^^T = Transpose^^
