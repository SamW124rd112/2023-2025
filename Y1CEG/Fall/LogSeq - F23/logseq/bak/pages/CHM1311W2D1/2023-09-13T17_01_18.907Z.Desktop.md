### Atomic Measurements
	- Macroscopic level
		- Units: g, L, etc...
	- Microscopic level
		- Units: ???
- ### Moles
	- The mole is an amount of substance that the same number of elementary entities as there are carbon-12 atoms in exactly 12g of carbon-12
		- $6.02214129 \times 10^{23}$
		- ^^The mole as defined is pre-2019^^
			- It is now known as $6.02214076 \times 10^{23}$
	- Molecular mass
		- Sum of atomic mass of each atom in the molecule (in $u$)
	- Molar mass
		- Mass, in grams of one mole of the substance
- ### Percent composition
	- Percent composition ^^(%)^^
		- number of parts in 100 (cent) parts of the whole
	- Parts per thousand ^^(ppt)^^
		- number of parts in 1000 parts of the whole
	- Parts per million ^^(ppm)^^
		- number of parts in 1000000 parts of the whole
	- **IMPORTANT**: must be defined by a unit
		- Ex. a rock contains 3.5% gold ^^**by mass**^^ means 3.5 g of gold per 100 g per of rock
		- Ex. a bottle of wine contains 10.7% alcohol ^^**by volume**^^ means 10.7 mL of alcohol per 100 mL of wine
		- Ex. an isotope occurring in nature with 1.8% ^^**abundance**^^ means 1.8 isotopes per 100 atoms over all
	- When expressed as a conversion factor the numerator and denominator must have the **SAME UNITS**
		- Ex. a rock contains 3.5% gold ^^**by mass**^^

	- Example:
	  background-color:: blue
		- Calculate the mass percent of hydrogen in ammonium bicarbonate
- ### Chemical Formulae
	- Empirical formula
		- Simplest whole number RATIO of elements
			- $CH_3O$
	- Molecular formula
		- Exact number of atoms of each element
			- $C_2H_6O_2$
	- Structural formula
		- Shows relative placement and connectivity of atoms
		- $HO(CH_2)_2OH$
	- Compound + excess $O_2$(g) $\rightarrow$ oxidation products (g)
		- Combustion analysis can help us determine the empirical formula by allowing us to measure the masses of each element, then using these to calculate the percent composition of each element
	- Example:
	  background-color:: blue
		- Complete combustion  of a 1.505 g sample of an unknown compound consisting of $C$, $H$, $S$ yields 3.149 g $CO_2$, 0.645 g $H_2O$ and some $SO_2$
- ### Chemical Equations
	- **The law of conservation of matter** states that matter must be conserved before and after a reaction
		- Like energy, it cannot be created or destroyed
		- Beacause of the principle of the ^^conservation of matter^^, an equation must be balanced
		- It must have the same number of atoms of the same kind on both sides
	- Remember to balance chemical equations **prior** to calculations
	- Elements and charges to should be balanced on the product and reactant sides of the equation
		- Take $NO(g) + O_2 \rightarrow NO_2(g)$
	- **DO NOT:**
		- Never introduce extraneous atoms to balance
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $NO(g) + O_2 \rightarrow NO_2(g) + O(g)$
			  background-color:: red
		- Never change a formula for the purpose of balancing an equation
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $NO(g) + O_2 \rightarrow NO_3(g)$
			  background-color:: red
	- **Instead:**
		- $2NO(g) + O_2 \rightarrow 2NO_2(g)$
- ### Stoichiometry
	- ^^Stoichiometry^^ is the study of the quantitative aspects of chemical reactions
	- Stoichiometric calculations can be made using this ^^mole method^^:
		- Identify all reactants and products
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Balance the chemical equation
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Follow the mole method
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- **mass of reactor** (molar mass) $\rightarrow$ **moles of reactant** (stoichiometric factor) $\rightarrow$ **moles of product** (molar mass) $\rightarrow$ **mass of product**
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Example:
	- ^^The theoretical yield^^ is calculated yield expected if the reactants react to completion
	- ^^The actual yield (or experimental yield)^^ is measured yield in laboratory
	- The actual yield can be smaller due to side product formation, incomplete reaction
	- It can be larger due to incomplete drying, impure final product
		- $$ \% \text{ yield}= \frac{\text{actual yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}} \times 100$$
	- Example:
	  background-color:: blue
	  collapsed:: true
		- $\text{2 Li}(s) + \text{2 H}_2\text{O} (l) \rightarrow \text{2 LiOH} (aq) + \text{H}_2 (g)$
		- If only 7.82 g of $\text{H}_2$ formed, what is the % yield of the reaction? (9.89 g $\text{LiOH}$ was needed)
			- $\% \text{ yield}= \frac{\text{actual yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}} \times 100$
			- $= \frac{7.82 \text{ g}}{9.89. \text{ g}} \times 100\%$
			- $= 79.1 \%$
