			- The possiblity exists for a force $F$ tangent to the surface (friction force) to act on the member, as well as a normal force $N$

			- A lateral force $P$ exerted by the guide on the wheel can exist, in addition to the normal force $N$

		- Ball and socket joint

			- A ball and socket joint free to about the centre of the ball can support a force $R$ with all three components

		- Fixed connection (embedded or welded)
			- ![Screenshot from 2023-10-08 00-52-43.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2023-10-08_00-52-43_1696740864748_0.png)
			- In addition to three components of force, a fixed connection can cause support a couple $M$ represented by its three components

			- Thrust bearing is capable of supporting axial force $R_y$ as well as radial forces $R_x$ and $R_z$
			- Couples $M_x$, and $M_z$ must, in some cases be assumed zero in order to provided statical determinacy

	- ### Excessive Fixity (Redundant Constraints)
		- Statically indeterminant $\rightarrow$ 7 unknowns

	- ### Incomplete Fixity (Partial Constraints)
		- No Moment Resistance about Line $AE$

		- No Force Resistance along $y$-axis

	- Example:
		- The uniform 7m steel shaft has a mass of 200kg and is supported by a ball-and-socket joint at $A$ in the horizontal floor. The ball end $B$ rests against the smooth vertical walls as shown. Compute the forces exerted by the walls and the floor on the ends of the shaft

		- A 200-N force is applied to the handle of the hoist in the direction shown. The bearing $A$ supports the thrust (force in the direction of the shaft axis), while bearing $B$ supports only radial load (load normal to the shaft axis). Determine the mass $m$ which can be supported and the total radial force exterted on the shaft by each bearing. Assume neither bearing to be capable of supporting a moment about a line normal to the shaft axis
