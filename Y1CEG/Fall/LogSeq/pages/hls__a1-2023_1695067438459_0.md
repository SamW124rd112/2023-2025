- (2 points) Write a function pale(n) that takes a positive integer n as input where n has four digits. The function determines if n is a pale number. A number is not pale if and only if it has at least two consecutive digits each equal to 3, or if its last digit is divisible by 4. The function should test if n is pale and returns True if n is pale and False otherwise. (In this function, you are not allowed to use strings.)
