- # [[Mechanics]]
	- Mechanics deals with the effects of forces on objects
		- It can be defined as the science which describes and predicts the conditions of (^^**STATICS**^^) or motion (^^**DYNAMICS**^^) of bodies under the action of forces
		- It is divided into 3 parts
			- Mechanics of rigid bodies
			- Mechanics of deformable bodies
			- Mechanics of fluids
- # [[Basic Concepts]]
	- Basic concepts in mechanics are
		- ### Space
			- Associated with the notion of the position of point P
			- This position can be defined by 3 lengths measured from a cetrain reference point, or origin in three given directions $$(x,y,z)$$
			- These are known as **coordinates** of P
			- Fig 1.1

		- ### Time
			- It is not enough to define the position of an event in space
			- The **time** of an event must also be given also
			- Fig 1.2

		- ### Mass
			- Used to characterize and compare bodies on the bases of certain fundamental mechanical experiements
				- Ex. Two bodies of the same mass will be attracted to the earth by the same manner
				- They will also offer the same resistance to change in translational motion
				- Fig 1.3

		- #### Force
			- Represents the action of one body on another
			- Can be exerted by actual contact or at a distance, such as gravitational and magnetic forces
			- Force is characterized by its ^^**point of application**^^, its ^^**magnitude**^^, and its ^^**direction**^^
			- Represented by a vector
			- Fig 1.4

	- These concepts cannot be easily defined, but they should be accepted on the basis of our intuition and experience
	- Other terms:
		- A ^^**particle**^^ is a very small amount of matter which is assumed to occupy a single point of space
		- A ^^**rigid body**^^ is a combination of a large number of particles occupying fixed positions with respect to each other
			- Geometry and shapes matter in rigid bodies
- # [[Scalar and Vectors]]
	- ## Scalar Quantity
		- A quantity with only magnitude
			- Ex: time, volume, density, speed, mass
	- ## Vector Quantity
		- Quantity with both magnitude and direction
			- Ex. displacement, velocity, acceleration, force
	- ## Types of vectors
		- #### Free vector
			- One whose action is not confined to or associated with a unique line in space
				- Ex. couple vector
		- #### Sliding vector
			- has a unique line of action in space but not a unique point of application
				- Ex. force on a rigid body
				- Fig 1.5
				  background-color:: red
		- #### Fixed vector
			- has a unique line of action and point of application
				- Ex. forces on deformable bodies
	- ## Conventions
		- Vector representation
			- Line segment with an arrowhead to indicate direction
			- Written in bold: ^^**v**^^
			- Magnitude written in italics: ^^*v*^^
		- Distinguish between scalars and vecots
			- Use an underline, over-arrow, under-squiggle, etc. to represent vectors
	- ## Working with vectors
		- Paralleogram Law of Addition - Vector Sum $$V = V_1 + V_2$$
			- Two vectors, $$V_1$$ and $$V_2$$, treated as free vectors, may be replaced by their equivalent vector $$V$$, which is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by $$V_1$$ and $$V_2$$
			- Called a vector sum
			- Fig 1.6
