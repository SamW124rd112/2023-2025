	- ### Definition of the Derivative at a Point - Slope of a Tangent
		- The **slope of the secant** passing through the points $(a,f(a)$ and  $(a+h, f(a+h)$ is

		- Our goal is for developing skills with limits was to take the limit as $h \rightarrow 0$
		- Provided the limit exists, the **derivative of a function** $f$ **at a number** $a$, denoted $f'(a)$ is
			- $$f'(a) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}  \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$$
		- Example
		  background-color:: blue
			- Find the equation of the tangent line to the graph $f(x) = \sqrt{x +3}$ at the point $x=1$

	- ### Instantaneous Rate of Change
		- If $f$ is ^^continuous^^ on the interval [$a,b$], the **average rate of change of** $f$ **on** [$a,b$] is
			- $$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
		- The **instantaneous rate of change of** $f$ **at** $x = a$ is

	- ### The Derivative as a Function
		- The derivative $f(x)$, denoted $f'(x)$, is the function
			- The domain of $f'(x)$ is the set of all $x$ in the domain of $f$, for which the above limit exists
			- The domain of $f'$ can be smaller than the domain of $f$
			- As a function of $x$, we can regard the value of $f'(x)$ geometrically as the slope of the tangent line of $f$ at $x$
	- ### Other Notation for the Derivative
		- For $y= f(x)$, here are several equivalent notations for the derivative $f'(x)$
			- $$f'(x) = y'$$
			- $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$
			- $$\frac{df(x)}{dx}$$
			- $$\frac{d[f(x)]}{dx}$$
			- $$Dxf(x)$$
	- ### Differentiability
		- A function is **differentiable** at $a$ if (the limit) $f'(a)$ exists
		- $f$ is **differentiable on an open interval** $I$ if $f'(a)$ exists for all $a \in I$
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Where is the function $f(x) =|x|$ differentiable?

		- #### If $f$ is differentiable at $a$, the $f$ is continuous at $a$
			- Being differentiable is much stronger than being continuous
			- If $f'(a)$ exists then $f$ is continuous in $a$
		- The converse of that theorem is false
			- $|x|$ is continuous $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ but not differentiable in $x = 0$
		- #### Additionally, if a function is not continuous, it is also not differentiable
	- ### How can functions fail to be Differentiable?

	- ### Higher-Order Derivatives
		- Let $y=f(x)$ be a function
		- In each case, the preceding derivative exists we can iterate to take **higher-order derivatives**
			- 1st derivative of $f$ : $f'(x) , y' , \frac{dy}{dx}$
			- 2nd derivative of $f$ : $f''(x) , y'' , \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ (Derivative of $f'$)
			- 3rd derivative of $f$ : $f'''(x) , y''' , \frac{d^3y}{dx^3}$ (Derivative of $f''$)
			- 4th derivative of $f$ : $f''''(x) , y'''' , \frac{d^4y}{dx^4}$ (Derivative of $f'''$)
			- $n$th derivative of $f$ : $f^n(x) , y^n , \frac{d^ny}{dx^n}$ (Derivative of $f^{n-1}$)
