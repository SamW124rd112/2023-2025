- data types in Python (including None)
- function design
- function calls
- docstrings
- functions that return values vs. functions that do not
- if statements

- while loops
- strings (including slicing)
- lists and tuples and operations on them including indexing, slicing, looping over elements of the list, looping over indices in the list
- sets and dictionaries including looping over them, accessing elements, search for keys in a dictionary
- object oriented programming (that is creating your own data types) including all the special function (whose names start and end with "_ _") that we learned in association with it.
- recursion (including the heigh/depth of recursion)
- order of execution
- mutable vs immutable objects (i.e. variables that refer to immutable objects like strings, numbers and tuples vs variables that refer to mutable objects such as lists and objects), memory, aliasing, aliasing that happens during function calls
- counting the number of operations (expressed as big O notation)
- LOGIC/ALGORITHMS/SOLVING COMPUTATIONAL PROBLEMS (understanding what a program/function does, writing programs etc) on all of the data types you have seen: lists,  strings, sets/dictionaries, your custom made data types (i.e. object oriented programming, recursion
