	- ### Average Value of a Function

		- What is the average value of a function on an interval $[a,b]$?
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-22 20-32-56.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-22_20-32-56_1705973607381_0.png)
		- ^^Idea^^: Chop the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal length $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and choose points in interval say, $x_i \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$
		- For each point, compute the value $f(x_i)$, then take the average of our $n$ sample point values:

		- As $n \rightarrow \infin$, our estimate captures more and more values of $f$, thus giving a better estimate of $f_{avg}$
		- The **average value of** $f$ **on** $[a,b]$ to be:
			- $$f_{avg} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infin} \frac{f(x_i)+...+f(x_n)}{n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infin} \frac{1}{b-a} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x$$
				- $$\Rightarrow f_{avg} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \ dx$$
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Find the average value of $f(x) = \sin (x)$ on $[0, \pi]$

	- ### Arc Length
	  id:: 65aff6e4-4a77-4b37-9031-4d5fb67e37cf
		- Assume we want to determine length of curve $y = f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-23 12-27-53.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-23_12-27-53_1706030892843_0.png)
		- ^^Idea^^: Chop the curve into $n$ pieces and estimate length of piece
		- When the pieces are small, they will be approximately straight, and correspond to small changes in $x$ and $y$
		- The curve can be approximated using Pythagorean theorem:
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-23 12-30-27.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-23_12-30-27_1706031078925_0.png)
		- When $\Delta x$ is small, we can approximate $\Delta y$ in terms of $x$ as follows:
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-23 12-31-28.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-23_12-31-28_1706031114069_0.png)
		- As the number of pieces $n \rightarrow \infin$ we get a formula:
			- $$L \approx \sum_{i=1}^n l_i \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{1+[f'(x_i)]^2} \Delta x$$
			- $$\therefore \lim_{n \rightarrow \infin} \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{1+[f'(x_i)]^2} \Delta x$$
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-23 12-34-51.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-23_12-34-51_1706031322291_0.png)
			- $$\Rightarrow L = \int_a^b \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2} $$
		- Though the formula is simple, it leads to difficult integrals
		- Length can be approximated in such a case
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Calculate the length of $y = 4x^{3/2}$ from $x=1$ to $x=4$
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-23 12-36-41.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-23_12-36-41_1706031418332_0.png)
- ## 6. [[Applications: Hydrostatic Force, Centre of Mass]] #[[MAT1322]]
	- ### Hydrostatic Pressure and Force
	  id:: 65b19077-6efe-48e9-8b57-febcb67db485
		- Suppose a horizontal plate of area $A$ is submerged in a fluid (at rest) of *mass density* $\rho$ $\text{kg/m}^3$ at a depth $d$ m below the surface of the fluid
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 18-58-36.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_18-58-36_1706399971975_0.png)
		- What is the force exerted on the plane
			- The fluid directly above the plate has volume $V = A \cdot d$ hence mass $m = \rho V = \rho Ad$ ($\rho$ = mass density)
			- $\therefore$ the force acting on the plate due to mass of water above it and gravity is:
				- $$F = mg = \rho g A d$$
		- The **pressure** $P$ on the plate is defined to be the force per unit area:
			- $$P = \frac{F}{A} $$ hydrostatic pressure is:
				- $$P = \frac{\rho g A d}{A} = \rho g d$$
		- **Important things to know about pressure in any fluid:**
			- At any point in a liquid, the pressure is the same in all directions
			- Pressure increases with depth
			- Since pressure is force/area, we have $P = \frac{F}{A} = \rho pdg$
		- **Beware of Units and Mass vs. Weight Density!**
			- Units $\text{Pa} = \frac{N}{m^2}$ (Pascals) compared to units in $\rho gd$ is:
			- $$(\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3})(\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2})(\text{m})$$ where
				- we have **mass density**, **gravity**, and **depth** respectively
			- Alternatively:
				- $$P = \delta d: \frac{\text{lb}}{\text{ft}^3}(\text{ft})$$ where
					- we we have **weight density** and **depth** respectively
			- ^^Note:^^ The weight density of $\delta$ of a fluid already incorporates gravity
				- Ex. weight density of water is $62 \text{lb/ft}^3$ and mass density is $1000 \text{kg/m}^3$
		- Example

	- ### Moments & Centre of Mass / Centroid of a Region
	  id:: 65b19747-2a18-424b-9fec-0fe627a46424
		- Suppose a flat rectangular plate of uniform density $\rho$ is situated in the $xy-$plane as follows:
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 19-04-54.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_19-04-54_1706400328902_0.png)
		- The mass of $R$ is the product of its area and its (uniform) density
			- The ^^moment^^ of $R$ about the ^^x-axis^^ is defined as the *product of:
			- $M_x =$ (mass of $R$) $\cdot$ ((signed) distance from $R$'s centre of mass to the $x-$axis)
				- $\Rightarrow M_x =$ (density) $\cdot$ (area of $R$) $\cdot$ ($\overline{y}$)
			- $M_x$ measures the tendency of $R$ to tip over or rotate around the $x-$axis
		- Similarly, the ^^moment^^ of $\R$ around the ^^y-axis^^ is as the product of:
			- $M_y = $ (mass of $R$) $\cdot$ ((signed) distance from $R$'s centre of mass to the $y-$axis)
				- $\Rightarrow M_y =$ (density) $\cdot$ (area of $R$) $\cdot$ ($\overline{x}$)
			- $M_y$ measures the tendency of $R$ to tip over or rotate around the $y-$axis
		- Suppose a flat plane of uniform density $\rho$ is shaped like the region $R$ is bounded by curves  $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ for $a \le x \le b$ as follows:
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 19-05-54.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_19-05-54_1706400382777_0.png)
		- We can slice $R$ up into $n$ rectangles and find the centre of mass of each rectangle as well as each rectangle's moment about the $x$ and $y-$axis
			- We can approximate the moment of $R$ about the $x-$axis as follows:
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 19-06-49.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_19-06-49_1706400478803_0.png)
				- $\therefore$ the exact moment of $R$ about $x-$ axis is:
					- $$M_x = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infin} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{2} \rho \{[f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2\} \Delta x$$
					- $$M_x = \int_a^b = \frac{1}{2} \rho \{[f(x)]^2 - [g(x)]^2\} \Delta x\ dx$$
			- We can approximate the moment of $R$ about the $y-$axis as follows:
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 19-07-12.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_19-07-12_1706400495294_0.png)
				- $\therefore$ the exact moment of $R$ about $y-$ axis is:
					- $$M_y = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infin} \sum_{i=1}^n \rho \cdot \overline{x_i} (f(\overline{x_i}) - g(\overline{x_i}) \Delta x$$
					- $$M_y = \int_a^b = \rho \cdot x(f(x) - g(x)) \ dx$$
		- The total mass of $R$ is $m=$ (density) $\cdot$ (area of $R$)
		- Therefore, a point of mass $m$ that is located at the centre of mass of $R$ should produce the same moments as $R$
		- Suppose ($\overline{x},\overline{y}$) are coordinates of $R$'s centre of mass (or **centroid**)
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 19-16-14.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_19-16-14_1706400997590_0.png)
		- Thus, $R$'s centre of mass is the point ($\overline{x},\overline{y}$) where:
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 19-17-00.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_19-17-00_1706401052007_0.png)
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Find the moments $M_x$ and $M_y$ and the centre of mass of a flat plane of uniform density $\rho = 1$ shaped like the region $R$ bounded by the curve $y = \cos(x)$ and the $x-$axis for $-\pi/2 \le x \le \pi/2$
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-27 19-18-04.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-27_19-18-04_1706401126078_0.png)
			- Find the centre of mass of a flat plate of uniform density whose shape corresponds to the region bounded by the line $y=x$ and $y = x^2$
