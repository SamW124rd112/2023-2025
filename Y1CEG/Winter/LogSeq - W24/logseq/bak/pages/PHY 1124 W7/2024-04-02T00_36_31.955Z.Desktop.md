	- ## 10.1 Torque
	- ## 10.2 Torque and Angular Acceleration for a Rigid Body
		- Consider a particle of mass $m$ rotating in a circle of radius $r$ under the influence of tangential force $\vec{F}_t$ and a radial force $\vec{F}_r$
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-03-04 13-10-43.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-03-04_13-10-43_1709575905060_0.png){:height 240, :width 187}
		- The tangential force provides a tangential acceleration:
			- $F_t = ma_t$
		- The **magnitude of the torque** produced by $F_t$ around the centre of the circle is
			- $$\tau = F_t r = (ma_t)r$$
		- The **tangential acceleration** is related to the **angular acceleration**
			- $$\tau = (ma_t)r = (mr\alpha)r = (mr^2)\alpha$$
		- Since $mr^2$ is the moment of inertia of a particle
			- $\tau = I \alpha$
			- The ^^torque is directly proportional to the angular acceleration^^ and the constant of proportionality is the moment of inertia
		- Consider the object consists of an infinite number of mass elements $dm$ of infinitesimal size
		- Each mass element rotates in a circle about the origin, $O$
		- Each mass element has a tangential acceleration
		- From Newton's Second Law
			- $$dF_t = (dm)a_t$$
		- The torque associated with the force and using the angular acceleration gives
			- $$d\tau = r dF_t = a_t r  \ dm = \alpha r^2 \ dm$$

		- $$d\tau = \alpha r^2 \ dm$$
		- Finding the net torque
			- $$\sum \tau = \int \alpha r^2 \ dm = \alpha \int r^2 \ dm$$
			- This becomes $\sum \tau = I \alpha$
				- This the same relationship that applied to a particle
				- ^^The net torque about the rotation axis is proportional to the angular acceleration, with the proportionality factor being the moment of inertia^^
	- ## 10.4 Work and Power in Rotational Motion
		- ### Work in Rotational Motion
			- Find the work done by $\vec{F}$ on the object as it rotates through the infinitesimal distance $ds = r \ d \theta$
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-03-04 13-21-51.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-03-04_13-21-51_1709576529897_0.png){:height 223, :width 216}
			- $$dW = \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{s} = (F \sin \phi) r \ d \theta$$
				- $F \sin \phi$ is the tangential component of $\vec{F}$
				- The radial component of $\vec{F}$ does no work because it is perpendicular to the displacement
					- $$dW = \tau \ d \theta$$
		- ### Power in Rotational Motion
			- The rate at which work is being done in a time interval $dt$ is the
				- $$P = \frac{dW}{dt} = \tau \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \tau \omega$$
				- $$\therefore P = \tau \omega$$
			- This analogous to $P= Fv$ in a linear system
			- $$\sum \tau = I \alpha = I \frac{d \omega}{dt} = I \frac{d \omega}{d \theta} \frac{d \theta}{dt} = I \frac{d \omega}{d\theta} \omega$$
			- $$dW = \sum \tau d \theta =I \omega d \omega$$
			- $$\sum W = \int_{\omega_i}^{\omega_f} I \omega d \omega = \frac{1}{2}I \omega^2_f - \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2_i$$
		- ### Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem of Rotational Motion
			- $$\sum W =  \frac{1}{2}I \omega^2_f - \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2_i$$
			- The net work done by the external forces in rotating a symmetric rigid object about a fixed friction-free axis equals the change in the object's rotational kinetic energy
			- The net work done by external forces on an object is the change in its **total** kinetic energy, which is the ^^sum of the translational and rotational kinetic energies^^
			- **For example,** when a pitcher throws a baseball, the work done by the pitcherâ€™s hands appears as kinetic energy associated with the ball moving through space as well as rotational kinetic energy associated with the spinning of the ball

	- ## 10.5 Angular Momentum
		- ### Rolling Object
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1709578107182_0.png)
			- Two points on a rolling object take different paths through space
			- The **red curve** shows the path moved by a **point on the rim of the object**
				- This path is called **cycloid**
			- The ^^green line^^ shows the path of the ^^centre of mass^^ of the object
		- ### Pure Rolling Motion
			- In *pure rolling motion*, an object rolls without slipping
			- In such a case, there is a simpe relationship between its rotational and translational motions
		- ### Rolling Object, Centre of Mass
			- As the cylinder rotates through an angle $\theta$, Its centre of mass moves a linear distance $s = R\theta$
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-03-04 13-52-23.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-03-04_13-52-23_1709578371408_0.png){:height 188, :width 285}
			- The velocity of the centre of mass is
				- $$V_{CM} = \frac{ds}{dt} = R \frac{d\theta}{dt} = R \omega$$
			- $\omega$ is the angular speed of the cylinder
			- The acceleration of the centre of mass is
				- $$a_{CM} = \frac{dV_{CM}}{dt} = R \frac{d \omega}{dt} = R \alpha$$
				- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration of the cylinder
			- The condition for **pure rolling motion is**  $V_{CM} = R \omega$
		- ### Rolling Object, Other Points
			- A point on the rim, $P$ rotates to various positions such as $Q$ and $P'$
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-03-04 14-16-20.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-03-04_14-16-20_1709579802786_0.png){:height 219, :width 233}
			- At any instant, the point on the rim located at point $P$ is at rest relative to the surface since no slipping occurs
			- All points on a rolling object move in a direction perpendicular to an axis through the instantaneous point of contact $P$, that is all points rotate about $P$
			- All points on a cylinder have the same angular speed
		- ### Rolling Motion
			- Rolling motion can be modeled as a combination of pure translational motion and pure rotational motion
			- The contact between the surface and object (in third figure) has a translational speed of zero
			- At this instant, the rolling object is moving in exactly the same way as if the surface were removed and the object were pivoted at point $P$ and spun about an axis passing through $P$

		- ### Total Kinetic Energy of a Rolling Object
			- $$K = \frac{1}{2} I_P \omega^2$$
			- $$I_P = I_{CM} + MR^2$$
			- $$K = \frac{1}{2} I_{CM} \omega^2 + \frac{1}{2} MR^2  \omega^2$$
			- $$V_{cm} = R \omega$$
			- $$K = \frac{1}{2} I_{CM} \omega^2 + \frac{1}{2} Mv^2  \omega^2$$
				- The total kinetic energy of a rolling object is the sum of the rotational kinetic energy *about* the centre of mass and the translational kinetic energy *of* the centre of mass
		- ### Rolling Down an Incline
			- Accelerated rolling motion is possible only if friction is present between the sphere and the incline
				- The friction produces the net torque required for rotation
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-03-04 14-29-13.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-03-04_14-29-13_1709580578426_0.png){:height 226, :width 301}
			- $$K = \frac{1}{2} I_{CM} \omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}Mv^2_{CM}$$
			- $$K = \frac{1}{2} I_{CM}(\frac{v_{CM}}{R})^2  \frac{1}{2}Mv^2_{CM} = K = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{I_{CM}}{R^2} +M)v^2_{CM}$$
			- $$K_f + U_f = K_i + U_i$$
			- $$\frac{1}{2} (\frac{I_{CM}}{R^2} +M)v^2_{CM} + 0  = 0 + Mgh$$
			- $$V_{CM} = \sqrt{\frac{2gh}{1 +\frac{I_{CM}}{MR^2}}}$$
			- Despite the presence of friction, there is no loss of mechanical energy since the ^^contact point^^ is at ^^rest^^ relative to the surface at any instance
			- On the contrary if the rigid body were to slide, mechanical energy would be lost as motion progressed
