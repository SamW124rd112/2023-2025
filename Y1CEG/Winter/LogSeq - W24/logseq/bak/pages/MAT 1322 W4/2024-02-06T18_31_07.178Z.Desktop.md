## 7. [[Differential Equations]] #MAT1322
	- ### Differential Equations
		- A **differential equation** is an equation involving an *unknown* function, say $y(x)$, its derivative(s), such as $y', y^n$, etc. and an indepent variable $x$
		- The **order** of a differential equation is the order of the highest-order derivative appearing in the equation
		- The **solution** to a differential equation is a function $y(x)$ satisfying the equation
		- ### Initial Value Problem
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Find the solution the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = x+7$
			- In the example, the solution to the differential equation contains an **arbitrary constant**
			- With the arbitrary constant, a solution is called the **general solution**
			- The **general solution** represents an entire family of solutions i.e curves, that have a slope $x+7$
			- Given an **initial condition** such as $y(x_0)$ = y_0$, we can solve for $C$ and obtain a **particular solution**
			- An **initial condition** gives us a specific point that the graph of the solution must pass through
				- Only one member of the family of all solutions must pass through a given point $(x_0, y_0)$
				- A **particular solution** is the unique solution passing the the point given by the initial condition
			- A differential equation together with an initial condition is called an **initial value problem**
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Solve the initial value problem $y' = x+7$ with initial condition $y(0) = 3$
		- ### Model for Population Growth
			- Suppose a population is growing under "ideal" conditions
			- In this situation, a reasonable and simple model for growth is:
				- Population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population
					- $$\frac{dP}{dt} = kP$$(the differential equation) where
						- $k$ is the proportionality constant
						- $t$ is time (independent variable)
						- $P$ is population size (dependent variable)
						- $P(t)$ is the unknown function (solution)
			- What properties of population growth does this model capture?
				- Assume $P > 0$
				- If $k >0$, then $\frac{dP}{dt} = kP > 0$ so population is always increasing
				- As $P$ increases $\frac{dP}{dt}$ increases aswell
			- For an exponential function $f(x) = b^x$, it's derivative satisfies:
				- $$\frac{df}{dx}  = \frac{d}{dx} [b^x] = f'(0) \cdot b^x = k \cdot f(x)$$
			- Example:
				- Verify that $P(t) = Ce^{kt}$ is a solution the differential equation $\frac{dP}{dt} = kP$. What does the constant $C$ represent in terms of this population?
		- ### Separable Differential Equations
			- A first order differentiable equation in which the expression for $dy/dx$ can be factored as the product of a function of $x$ and a function of $y$ is called a **separable differential equation**
				- So a separable differential equation is of the form $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$,
				- Where the function $f(x,y)$ can be factored as $f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)$
			- **Method for Solving a Separable Differential Equation**
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Our guess for the exponential solution to our model seems like dumb luck; however, now we notice that $\frac{dP}{dt} = kP$ is a separable differential equation
				- Solve the **initial value problem** given by $\frac{dy}{dx} = xy^2 \cos(x^2) \quad y(0) =1$
				- Find the **general solution** to the differential equation $\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2y$
		- ### Direction Fields
			- Suppose we have a first order differential equation of the form $y' = f(x,y)$
				- ^^**Idea**^^
					- If we are trying to solve $y' = f(x,y)$, then we know that the slope of $y$ must be equal to $f(x,y)$ at the point (coordinates) $(x,y)$
					- At the coordinates $(x,y)$, on the $xy-$plane, calculate $y' = f(x,y)$ and plot a small line segment that indicates this slope
					- Do this for many points to obtain what is called a **slope field** or a **direction field**
					- Each line segment of a particular slope indicates the direction a solution curve passing through those coordinates is heading
				- Example:
				  background-color:: blue
					- Draw a slope/direction field for the differential equation $y' = x+y$. Trace a rough graph of the particular solution with initial condition $y(0) = 2$
