## 12. [[Remainder Estimate Error Bounds & Limit Comparision Test]] #[[MAT 1322]]
	- ### Error Bounds for the Integral Test
		- ^^**Recall:** The Integral Test^^
			- Suppose $f$ is a continuous positive, decreasing function on  $[1, \infin)$, and let $a_n = f(n)$
			- Then, ($\sum_{n=1}^\infin a_n$ is convergent) if and only if ($\int_1^\infin f(x) \ dx$ is convergent)
		- Suppose that $\sum_{n=1}^\infin a_n$ is convergent by virtue  of the integral
		- How close is $\int_1^\infin f(x) \ dx$ to the actual sum $\sum_{n=1}^\infin a_n$
		- It can be measured by the goodness of an estimate based on the **remainder**
		- $$R_n = \sum_{k = n+1}^\infin a_k = a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} + ...$$
		- $R_n$ is the "infinite tail" of the series
