		- Consider a solid object between $x \in [a,b]$:
		- ^^**Idea:**^^
			- Break interval into $n$ parts of equal thickness $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and let $x_i = a + i \Delta x$ for $i = 0,1,...,n$
			- On each subinterval, and determine the cross-sectioned area ($A(x_i)$) of a solid in a plane perpendicular to the $x-$axis
			- The approximate volume of $n$ subsections is thus:
				- $$V \approx \sum_{i=1}^n A(x_i) \Delta x$$
			- So as $n \rightarrow \infin$ we get the exact volume in terms of a definite integral
				- $$V= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infin} \sum_{i =1}^n A(x_i) \Delta x = \int_a^b A(x) \ dx$$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Find the volume of the solid by rotating about the $x-$axis the region under the curve $y = \sqrt{x}$ from $0$ to $1$

	- ### Volumes by Cylindrical Shells
	  id:: 65a89521-eb80-4247-9e2a-ae02e2b9ec65
		- **Idea for using the method of cylindrical shells:**
			- Decompose solid into $n$ nested cylindrical shells of thickness $\Delta x$ (or $\Delta y$) whose combined volume would approximate be the volume of the solid
			- The cylindrical shell would be nested in the subinteval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$, we compute approximate radius and height of shell
			- The approximate total volume of solid, using $n$ nested cylindrical shells, is therefore:
				- $$V \approx \sum_{i=1}^n 2\pi R(x_i)H(x_i) \Delta x$$
			- So as $n \rightarrow \infin$, we get exact volume in terms of definite integral:
				- $$V = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infin}^n \sum_{i=1}^n 2 \pi R(x_i)H(x_i) \Delta x = \int_a^b 2\pi R(x)H(x) \ dx$$

			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Determine the volume of a solid obtained by rotating about the line $x =3$ the region bounded by $y=2-x^2$ and $y=x^2$

	- ### Work
	  id:: 65a89521-09b6-40d2-827f-7c25232c64f9
		- If an object is moved a distance $d$ against a constant force $F$, then the work done is
			- $$W = Fd$$
		- If force varies with distance, then the path of the object can be broken down into parts over which for is approximately constant, then sum over the pieceis
			- Chop $[a.b]$ into $n$ subintervals of width $\Delta x$
			- Take sample point $x_i$ from $i$th subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-21 14-12-09.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-21_14-12-09_1705864384773_0.png)
			- To approximate the work the object from $x_{i-1}$ to $x_i$, the force can be assumed to be constant so that
			- $$W_i \approx f(x_i) \Delta x$$ where
			- $f(x_i)$ is the approximate constant force throughout $i$th subinterval
			- $\Delta x$ is the length of $i$th subinterval
			- Total work to move object form $a$ to $b$ is approximately
		- ^^**Warning:**^^ Beware of *units*, and **mass** versus **weight**:
			- $F = ma$
				- Metric units $N= kg \cdot m/s^2$
				- Customary units $lbs$ (already includes acceleration due to gravity)
			- $W = Fd$
				- Metric units $J = N\cdot m$
				- Customary units $ft-lbs$
			- If $F$ is measured in **newtons** and $d$ in **metres**, then the unit for $W$ is a ^^newton-metre^^ or **joule**, $J$
			- If $F$ is measured in **pounds** and $d$ in **feet**, then the unit for $W$ is a ^^foot-pound^^, $ft-lb$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- A tank filled with water has the shape of an isosceles trapezoid (at the ends). The tank is $1$m wide and $1.5$m tall. The top of the tank measures $2$m and the bottom of the tank measures $1$m (water density $p = 1000 kg/m^3$). How much work is required to pump all the water out of the tank?

				- If instead we wanted to pump the water to a height $2$m above the top of the tank, how would the problem change?

				- If the tank was only filled to a height of $1$m, and we wanted to pump the water to the top of the tank, how would the problem change?

				- A $200$-lb cable is $100$ft long and hangs vertically from the top of a tall building. How much work is required to lift the cable to the top of the building

			- ### Hooke's Law
				- **Hooke's Law** states the force required to maintain a spring stretched beyond its natural length is:
					- $$f(x)=kx$$ where
					- $k$ is the **spring constant** provided $x$ is not too large
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-01-17 18-26-30.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-01-17_18-26-30_1705534076141_0.png)
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- A force of 40 $N$ is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from it's natural length of 10 cm to a length of 15 cm. How much work is done in stretching the spring 15cm to 18cm?
