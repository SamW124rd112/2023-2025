	- ### What is Nanotechnology
		- Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale to produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises  scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer  products, energy, materials, and manufacturing
		- Nanotechnology refers to  engineered structures, devices, and systems. Nanomaterials have a 
		  length scale between 1 and 100 nanometers.
		- Nanomaterials are substances that are, or have been, reduced in size to the range from 1 nm to ~ 100 nm (i.e. 1 to ~ 100 nanometers, or 1 to ~ 100 × 10-9 meters). ***Nanotechnology***
		   is the science and applications of nano-materials, and is growing at an
		   ever increasing pace. At this particle size the properties of materials
		   can be altered dramatically
		- Properties such as solubility, 
		  reactivity, spectroscopy, electrical and magnetic, transport through 
		  membranes etc. are generally different from those of the same materials 
		  with large particle size.
	- ### Challenges
		- Enivornmental Pollution
			- ifferent types of nano-TiO2, different pathways of entry, and
			   different effects on the environment and organisms were shown by 
			  comparing several studies of the influence of nanoparticles, exemplified
			   by TiO2, on different kinds of organisms, including 
			  bacteria, algae, invertebrates, fish, and plants. Their reported effects
			   on aquatic organisms included decreased reproduction of daphnia as well
			   as respiratory distress, pathological changes in the gills and in 
			  testine, and behavioral changes in fish

			- *in vivo* studies, which have focused on respiratory exposure in 
			  mostly laboratory rodents, raises concerns about lung injury, 
			  inflammation, and possible tumorgenesis, the results from *in vitro*
			   studies, using different tissue and cell cultures, suggest that 
			  oxidative stress (resulting from the production of reactive oxygen 
			  species) may be a possible mechanism of toxicity
		- Health Risks to Humans

				- The effect of nanomaterials on ecosystems is mostly unknown
			- The lack of methods to transfer colloidal particles via the cell wall makes a protective barrier in prokaryotic cells surface, preventing many nanoparticles from being absorbed
			- Eukaryotes have routes for nanoparticle and microparticle entry, such as endocytosis and phagocytosis
		- Barriers and Research needs
			- Large scale testing of certain nanotechnologies is required, as their long-term efficacy is still unknown
			- The other is cost, as it is extremely expensive
				- One solution is to use low-purity nanomaterials without siginficant comprise to efeeciency, as large cost is involved in the materials seperation and purificaton
				- Nanotechnology based solutions are difficult to implement in developed companies with carefully designed system for long lasting use

	- ### Wastewater and Water Treatment
		- https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/water-safety-and-quality/household-water-treatment-and-safe-storage
			- Globally, nearly two billion people use either unimproved drinking-water
			   sources or improved sources that are faecally-contaminated. Close to 
			  half a million diarrhoeal deaths in low- and middle-income countries are
			   attributed to inadequate drinking-water, and the vast majority of these
			   deaths occur among children under 5.

		- Nanomaterials are typically defiend as materials smaller than 100nm in atleast one dimension
		- Drawback of **Carbon Nanotubes**
			- Its low absorbption affiinty for low molecular wieght polar combounds, resulting in unneccessary molecular bonding processes
			- CNT are not a good replaceement for activated carbon as a wide-spectrum adsorbent, it is better to tuned to target specific compounds as it has the ability to remove recalcitrant compounds
		- Metal-based nanoabsorbers are effective low cost absorbenbts for heavy metals and radionuclides
			- Two step process: fast adsorption of metail ions on the external surface followed by rate-limiting intraparticle diffusion along micropore walls
			- Their nanoscale counterparts have higher adsorption capacity and faster kinetics because of the higher specific surface area, shorter  intraparticle diffusion distance and larger number of surface reaction sites (i.e., corners, edges, vacancies)
			- The smaller the nano-magentite particle, the absorption of arsenic drastically increases
			- It also has superparamegnetic properties
		- Membarnes are  physical bariers for stopping constituents based of their size
			- They are easy to reuse, provide a high-level of automation and require less land and chemical use and allow for a fleximble design
			- The inherit drawback is the need to choose between membrane selectivity and permeability
		- ##### Barriers and Research needs
			- Large scale testing of certain nanotechnologies is required, as their long-term efficacy is still unknown
			- The other is cost, as it is extremely expensive
				- One solution is to use low-purity nanomaterials without siginficant comprise to efeeciency, as large cost is involved in the materials seperation and purificaton
				- Nanotechnology based solutions are difficult to implement in developed companies with carefully designed system for long lasting use
