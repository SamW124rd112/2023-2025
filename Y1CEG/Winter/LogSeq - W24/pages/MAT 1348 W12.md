## [[Graph Theory]]
	- ## 10.1 Introduction
		- ### Basic Definitions of Graph Theory
			- A **graph** $G$ is an ordered pair $G = (V(G),E(G))$, where
				- $V(G)$ is a non empty set whose elements are called **vertices**
					- $V(G)$ is called the **vertex set** of $G$
				- $E(G)$ is a set whose elements are called **edges**
					- $E(G)$ is called the **edge set** of $G$
			- $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are related to each other by a function
				- $\mathtt{G}: E(G) \rightarrow \Big \{ \{u,v\}: u, v \in V(G)\Big\}$
				- $\mathtt{G}$ is called the **incidence function** of $G$
			- For each edge $e \in E(G)$, $\psi_G(e) =${the endpoints(s) of the edge $e$}
			- ^^**Remark:**^^
				- Although we are using the word "graph", a graph, as defined above, is not the same as the graph of a function
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V(G) = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\}$ and edge set $E(G) = \{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5\}$ whose incidence function $\psi_G$ is defined as follows:
			- **Additional Terminology**
				- An edge $e \in E(G)$ is called a **loop** if $\mathtt{G}(e) = \{v\}$
					- for some vertex $v \in V(G)$ (i.e the endpoint of $e$ coincide)
				- An edge $e \in E(G)$ is called a link if $\mathtt{G}(e) = \{u,v\}$
					- for two distinct vertices $u,v \in V(G), u \ne v$
				- Distinct edges $e_1$ and $e_2$ are called **parallel edges** if $\psi_G(e_1) = \psi_G (e_2)$
					- $e_1$ and $e_2$ share the same endpoints
				- A graph $G$ is called a **simple graph** if $G$ has no loops and no parallel edges
			- **Observations**
				- If $G$ is a graph with no parallel edges, then we can think of an edge $e$ interchangeably with its endpoints (since there is at most one edge joining any set of endpoints)
				- If $G$ has parallel edges, then we need the incidence function $\psi_G$ to keep track of which edge we are talking about when we consider two endpoints
		- ### More Graph Terminology and Conventions
			- Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph
				- Vertices $u,v, \in V(G)$ are called **adjacent** or **neighbours** if there is some edge $e \in E(G)$ such that $\psi_G (e) = \{u,v\}$
				- **Notation for adjacency**
					- $u \sim v$ means "$u$ and $v$ are adjacent"
				- An edge $e \in E(G)$ is said to be **incident** with its endpoints
			- For **undirected** graphs (which are the types of graphs we will consider) there is no importance placed on the order in which we specify the endpoint(s) of an edge
			- There is also the notion of a **directed graph** where the order of endpoints of an **arc** is taken into consideration
		- ### The Adjancency Matrix of A Graph
			- Suppose $G$ is an undirected graph with $n$ vertices labelled $v_1,v_2,..., v_n$
			- The **adjacency matrix** of $G$ is an $n\times n$ matrix $A = [a_{ij}]$ whose $(i,j)$-entry $a_{ij}$ (the entry in row $i$ and column $j$) is
				- $$a_{ij} = |\{e \in E(G): \mathtt{G}(e) = \{v_i, v_j\}\}$$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
	- ## 10.2 Degrees
		- Let $G$ be a graph
			- The **degree** of a vertex  $u \in V(G)$, denoted $\text{deg}_G(u)$ is
				- Number of edges incident with $u$, where each ^^loop^^ incident with $u$ is ^^counted twice^^ (each loop incident with $u$ contributes 2 to $\text{deg}_G(u)$)
					- If $\text{deg}_G(u) = 0$, then $u$ is called **isolated**
					- If $\text{deg}_G(u) = 1$, then $u$ is called a **leaf** or **pendant vertex**
			- Suppose $V(G) = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$
				- The **degree sequence** of $G$ is the sequence:
					- $$\Big( \text{deg}_G(v_1), \text{deg}_G(v_2), ..., \text{deg}_G(v_n) \Big)$$
			- ^^**Note:**^^
				- The entries of a degree sequence may be listed in any order, but most often we list the degrees in non-decreasing order
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
		- ### The Handshaking Theorem
			- Let $G$ be any graph, then:
				- $$\sum_{u \in V(G)} \text{deg}_G(u) = 2|E(G)|$$
				- **Proof:** Let $G$ be a graph
					- Let $e$ be any edge of $G$
					- Either $e$ is a loop, or $e$ is a link
					- ^^**Case 1**^^
						- Assume $e$ is a link
							- Then $e$ has two distinct endpoints, say $u$ and $v$, and $e$ will contribute 1 to $\text{deg}_G(u)$ and $e$ will contribute 1 to $\text{deg}_G(v) in the sum
					- ^^**Case 2**^^
						- Assume $e$ is a loop
							- Then $e$ has only one endpoint, say $u$, and $e$ will contribute 2 to $\text{deg}_G(u)$ in the sum
					- In both cases $e$ will contribute 2 in total to the degree sum
					- Since this is true of any edge $e \in E(G)$, it follows, that the total degree sum must equal to twice the number of edges
			- Example:
				- Verify that the equation of the Handshaking Theorem is true for each of the undirected graphs in these notes
					- For each of the following sequences, determine whether there exists a graph with that sequence as its degree sequence
					- If so, does there exists a **simple** graph with that sequence as its degree sequence
						- $(0,1,1)$
						  logseq.order-list-type:: number
						- $(1,2,3)$
						  logseq.order-list-type:: number
						- $(1,2,2,3)$
						  logseq.order-list-type:: number
						- $(3,3,3,3)$
						  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ### Some Important Families of Graphs
			- #### Complete Graphs:
				- Let $n$ be a positive integer
					- The **complete graph on** $n$ **vertices** is denoted $K_n$
					- $|V(K_n)| = n$
					- $$E(K_n) = \Big \{ \{u,v\}: u,v \in V(K_n), u \ne v\Big\}$$
				- In $K_n$, every subset of 2 distinct vertices forms the endpoints of one edge
					- $\therefore$ there are $\Big(\begin{matrix} n \\2 \end{matrix} \Big)$
				- Note that each vertex in $K_n$ is adjacent to all $n-1$ other vertices, so the degree of each vertex in $k_n$ is $n-1$
					- Degree sequence of $k_n$ is $(n-1,...,n-1)$
				- By the Handshaking Theorem
					- (# edges in $k_n$) = $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{u \in V(K_n)} \text{deg}_{K_n}(u) = \frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$
			- #### Cycles
				- Let $n$ be a positive integer
					- The **cycle of length** $n$ is denoted $C_n$
						- $|V(C_n)| =n$
						- Suppose $V(C_n) = \{u_1, u_2, ..., u_n\}$
							- Then $E(C_n) = \Big\{ \{u_1, u_2\}, \{u_2, u_3\}, ..., \{u_{n-1},u_n \}, \{u_n, u_1\}\Big\}$
			- #### Paths:
				- Let $n$ be a positive integer
					- The **path of length** $n$ is denoted $P_n$
						- $|V(P_n)| = n+1$
						- Suppose $V(P_n) = \{u_0, u_1, u_2, ..., u_n\}$
							- Then $E(P_n) =  \Big\{ \{u_0, u_1\}, \{u_1, u_2\}, \{u_2, u_3\}, ..., \{u_{n-1},u_n \}\Big\}$
	- ## 10.3 Isomorphism
		- Let $G$ and $H$ be simple graphs
			- An **isomorphism** from $G$ to $H$ is a bijection $f: V(G) \rightarrow V(H)$ such that for all $u, v \in V(G)$
				- $$\Big(\{u,v\} \in E(G) \Big) \Leftrightarrow \Big( \{f(u), f(v)\} \in E(H)\Big)$$
			- Graphs $G$ and $G$ are called **isomorphic** if there exists an isomorphic from $G$ to $H$
			- $G \cong H$ means "$G$ and $H$ are isomorphic"
		- Let $A$ denote the set of all finite simple graphs
		  background-color:: blue
			- Let us a define a relation on $A$ that relates graphs according to the following rule
				- For all $G,H \in A$, $G$ is related to $H \Leftrightarrow G \cong H$
			- **Observations**
				- For all $G \in A, G \cong G$
					- The identity function $\text{id}_{V(G)}: V(G) \rightarrow V(G)$ turns out to be an isomorphism from $G$ to itself
						- $\therefore \ \cong$ is a ^^reflexive^^ relation
				- For all $G,H \in A,$ if $G \cong H$, then $H \cong G$
					- Suppose $f$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to $H$
						- Then $f$ is a bijection, hence $f$ is invertible
						- $f^{-1}$ will define an isomorphism from $H$ to $G$
							- $\therefore \ \cong$ is a ^^symmetric^^ relation
				- For all $G, H, L \in A$, if $G \cong H$ and $H \cong L$, then $G \cong L$
					- Suppose $f$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to $H$ and suppose $g$ is an isomorphism from $H$ to $L$
						- $\therefore$ the composition $g \circ f: V(G) \rightarrow V(L)$ will define isomorphism from $G$ to $L$
						- $\therefore \cong$ is a ^^transitive^^ relation
			- So graph isomorphism defines a relation
		- Isomorphism is defined similarly for directed graphs, but we need to make sure that the direction of "arcs" is also preserved by the isomorphism
		- To prove $G \cong H$ we construct an isomorphism from $G$ to $H$
			- Give a **bijection** $f: V(G) \rightarrow V(H)$ and verify that
				- $$\Big(\{u,v\} \in E(G) \Big) \Leftrightarrow \Big( \{f(u), f(v)\} \in E(H) \Big)$$ for all $u,v \in V(G)$
	- ## 10.4 Subgraphs
		- Let $H$ and $G$ be graphs
			- $H$ is called a **subgraph** of $G$, denoted $H \subseteq G$ if both $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and $E(H) \subseteq (G)$
		- Example:
			- Verify that $H$ is a subgraph of $G$
			- Draw all the subgraphs with exactly 3 edges
	- ## 10.5 Bipartite Graphs
		- A graph $G$ is called **bipartite** or $2-colourable$ if we can colour the vertices of $G$ using 2 colours that no two neighbours (pair of adjacent vertices) are assigned the same colour
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Which of the following graphs are bipartite?
		- ### Complete Bipartite Graphs
			- Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers
			- The **complete bipartite graph**, denoted $K_{m,n}$ is defined as follows:
				- Let $X =  \{x_1, ..., x_m\}$ and let $Y = \{y_1, ..., y_n\}$ be sets such that
					- $|X| = m, |Y| = n,$ and $X \cap Y = \emptyset$
				- Let $V(K_{m,n}) = \{x_1,..., x_m\} \cup \{y_1, ..., y_n\}$
					- So $\{x,y\}$ is a partition of $V(K_{m,n})$ into two classes
				- Then $E(K_{m,n}) = \Big \{\{x_i, y_j\}: x_i \in X \text{ and } y_j \in Y\}$
				-
				-
	- ## 10.6 Planar Graphs
		- A graph $G$ is **planar** if it can be drawn on the plane without any intersecting edges
			- Such a drawing is called a **planar embedding** of $G$
		- To **contract** an edge $e$ of a graph $G$ is to remove $e$, and fuse together the vertices incident to $e$
			- The resulting graph is denoted $G/e$
		- If $G$ is planar and $v$ is a vertex of $G$, then $G-v$ is planar
		- If $G$ is planar and $ab$ is an edge of $G$, then $G-ab$ is planar
		- If $G$ is planar and $ab$ is an edge of $G$, then $G/ab$ is planar
		- ^^**Theorem:**^^
			- A graph $G$ is not planar if and only if $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ can be obtained from $G$ via a sequence of vertex deletions, edge deletions and edge contractions
	- ## 10.7 Chromatic Number
		- Let $G$ be a graph
			- A **colouring** of $G$ is a way of assigning a colour to every vertex of $G$ such that two adjacent vertices recieve different colours
			- The minimum number of colours needed to colour G is the **chromatic number** of $G$, denoted $x^{(G)}$
