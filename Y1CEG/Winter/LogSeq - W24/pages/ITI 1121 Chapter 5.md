## [[Polymorphism]]
	- ### Object
		- A reference of type **Object** can be used to designate any object
	- ### Object/Equals
		- The class `Object` defines a method `equals`
		- Consider two references, `a` and `b`, and the designated objects
			- Comparing the **identity** of two objects, - do `a` and `b` designate the same object
				- `(a == b)`
			- Comparing **content** of the designated objects
				- User wants to know if two objects is the same, use the method `equals`: **logical equality**
		- Make sure all fields are checked to be equal
			- For **primitive** types use, (`==`)
			- For **reference** types, `equals`
			- Be careful for `null` references
	- ### `instanceOf()`
		- The operator `instanceOf()` returns **false** is value of the value of `s` is `null`, otherwise the operator returns **true** if the class of the object designated by `s` at runtime, is compatible with type `T`that is:
			- `T` is a class, and object designated by `s`is an instance of `T`, or an instance of a subclass of `T`
			- `T` is an interface, and the object designated by `s` is an instance of a class that implements `T`
	- ### Generic Data Structures
		- The **advantage** of generic data structures is that a single implementation can be used in a variety   of contexts (any object that can be created in Java can be stored in such data structure)
		- The **drawback** is that the type of the return value of the access methods (getters) is `Object`, consequently requiring type casting
	- Java offers a concept called **Generics** when introducing class parameters
		- Creates a class without a defined object
		- The declaration of parameter, represents the type of objects to be stored in the class
	- A **generic type** is  a type with formal type parameters
	- A **parameterized type** is an instantiation of a generic type with actual type arguments
	- ### Implementation
		- Generics are implemented by **erasure**, which means type of parameters are present at compile time only
		- Generic types are present at compile time, where they are used for type checking, but are removed (erased) to produce the compiled (byte-code) representation of the program
	- ### Type Erasure
		- `A.java` and `b.java` are both producing the same byte-code
		- Generics implicitly perform the same cast that is explicitly performed without generics, but the implicit cast added by compilation of genetics
		- This:
			- Keeps everything simple and back-compatible
			- Economical; one byte-code for all its usages
-
