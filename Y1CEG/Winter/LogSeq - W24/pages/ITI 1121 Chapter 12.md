## [[Binary Search Trees]]
	- ### Binary Tree
		- A **binary tree** is a hiearchical data structure such that each **node** stores a **value** and has at msost two children, **left** and **right**
		- All nodes except one have exactly one parent
			- **Root** is node with no parent
			- EAch hode has 0,1, or 2 children
			- Nodes that have no children are called **leaves** or external nodes
			- Links between nodes are called **branches**
		- A node its **descendents** are a **subtree**
		- The **size** of  a tree is number of nodes in a tree
		- The **depth of a node** is the number of links starting from the rooth that must be followed to reach that node
			- The root is the most accessible node
		- The **depth of a tree** is the depth of the deepest node
		- A **binary search tree** is a binary tree such that
			- The nodes of a left sub-tree contain elements that are less than the elements stored at the local root
			- The nodes of a right sub-tree contain elements that are greater than the element stored at the local root
			-
	- ### **Applications**
		- Representing hiearchical information
		- Efficient data structure to implement abstract data types such as heaps, priority queues and sets
