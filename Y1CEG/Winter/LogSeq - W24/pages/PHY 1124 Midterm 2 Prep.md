	- Centre of Mass
		- Special point in a system or object, that moves as if all the mass of the system is concentrated at that point
		- System will move as if an external force were applied to a single particle of mass $M$ located at the centre of mass
		- $$x_{CM} \equiv \frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$

	- Motion of System of Particles
		- We can describe the **motion of the system** in terms of ^^the velocity and acceleration of the centre of mass of the system^^
		- Newton's Second Law for a System of Particles
			- The centre of mass of a system of particles of combined mass $M$ moves like an equivalent particle of mass $M$ would move under the influence of the net external force on the system
		- Momentum of a System of Particles
			- The total linear momentum of a system of particles is conserved if no net external force is acting on the system
	- Rocket Propulsion
		- The operation of a rocket depends on the law of conservation of linear momentum as applied to a system of particles, where the system is the rocket plus its ejected fuel
		- The **initial mass** if rocket with all fuel is $M + \Delta m$
		- **Initial momentum** of the system is $\vec{p}_i = (M + \Delta m)\vec{v}$
		- After some time, rocket mass reduces to $M$, with $\Delta m$ amount of fuel ejected, causing increase in velocity
		- Gases are given momentum when ejected out of engine, rocket recieves compensating momentum in opposite direction, acting as thrust
		- In free space, centre of mass of system moves independently of propulsion process
		- $v_e$ - speed of the ejected fuel relative to the rocket
		- $v - v_e$ - speed of the ejected fuel relative to the Earth
		- The increase in rocket speed is proportional to the speed of the escape gases $(v_e)$
		- The increase in rocket speed is also proportional to the natural log of the ratio $M_i/M_f$
		- Thrust on the rocket is the force exerted on it by the ejected exhaust gases
			- Thrust increases as exhaust speed increases, rate of change of mass, burn rate also increases

	- Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem of Rotational Motion
		- Net work done by external forces on a object in its **total** kinetic energy, the ^^sum of translational and rotational kinetic energies^^
	- Rolling Motion
		- In *pure rolling motion*, an object rolls without slipping
		- As a cylidner rotates through angle $\theta$, its centre of mass moves a linear distance $s = R\theta$
		- The condition for **pure rolling motion** is $V_{CM} = R \omega$
		- All points on a cylinder have the same angular speed
		- All points on a rolling move in a direction perpendicular to an axis through the instantaneous point of contact
		- The total kinetic energy of a rolling object is the sum of the rotational kinetic energy *about* the centre of mass and the translational kinetic energy *of* the centre of mass
	- Rolling Down an Incline
		- Acclelerated rolling motion is possible only if friction is present between sphere and incline, where friction produces the net torque required for rotation
		- There is **no loss** of mechanical energy since the contact point is at rest relative to surface at any instance
	- Angluar Momentum
		- Instantaneous Angular Momentum $L$ of a particle relative to the origin $O$ is defined as the cross product of particle's instantaneous position vector $\vec{r}$ and linear momentum $\vec{p}$
			- $$\sum \tau = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}$$
	- Torque and Angular Momentum
		- Torque acting on a particle is equal to the time rate of change of the particle's angular momentum
		- A particle in uniform circular motion has a constant angular momentum about an axis through the centre of its path
		- The total angular momentum of a system of particles is defined as the vector sum of the angular momentum of individual particles
		- Any torque associated with internal forces acting in a system of particles are zero
		- Net external torque acting on a system about some axis passing through an origin in a intertial frame equals the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of the system about the origin
		- Total angular momentum of a system can vary with time if a net external torque is acting on the system
		- Each particle of an object rotates in $xy$ plane about $z$ axis with angular speed $\omega$
		- Rotational form of Newton's 2nd Law is valid for a rigid object rotating about a moving axis if it passes through the centre of mass and is a symmetry axis
		- If a symmetrical object passes rotates about fixed axis passing through centre of mass, $L = I \omega$ holds, the total angular momentum w.r.t axis or rotation
	- Conservation Law
		- Total Angular Momentum of a system is constant in both magnitude and direction if the resultant external torque acting on the system is zero
			- $$\sum \tau_{ext} = \frac{d \vec{L}_{tot}}{dt} = 0 \rightarrow L_{tot} = \text{constant}$$
		- If the mass of an isolated system undergoes redistribution, the moment of inertia changes
		- Conservation of angular momentum requires a compensating change in angular velocity ($I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f$)
		- For a isolated system:
			- Conservation of Energy $\rightarrow E_i = E_f$
			- Conservation of Linear Momentum $\rightarrow p_i = p_f$
			- Conservation of Angular Momentum $\rightarrow L_i = L_f$
		- Moment of inertia of the system is the moment of inertia of the ^^platform^^ plus the moment of inertia of the mass
		- As the person moves toward the centre of rotating platform, the angular speed will increase
	- Motion of a Top
		- The only external forces acting on the top are the normal and gravitational force
		- Direction of angular momentum along the axis of symmetry
		- Normal force produces no torque
		- Top undergoes precessional motion
			- Precessional motion is the motion of the symmetry axis about the vertical
			- Precession is usually slow relative to the spinning motion of the top
	- Gyroscope
		- A gyroscope can used to illustrate precessional motion
		- Gravitational force produces a torque about the pivot, and this torque is perpendicular to the axle
		- Normal force produces no torque
		- Torque results in a change in angular momentum in a direction perpendicular to the axle
		- The gyroscope experiences precessional motion

- ## [[Periodic Motion]]
	- Periodic Motion
		- **Periodic motion** is the repeating motion of an object in which it continues to return to a given position after fixed time interval
		- Repetitive movements are called *oscillations*
			- A special kind of periodic motion occurs in mechanical systems when the force acting on the object is proportional to the position of the object relative to some equilibrium position
				- If force is always directed toward equilibrium position, the motion is called **simple harmonic motion**
	- Motion of a Spring Mass System
		- ![Screenshot from 2024-03-10 03-55-09.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-03-10_03-55-09_1710057333676_0.png)
	- Acceleration
		- When block is displaced from equilibrium point and released, it is a particle under a net force and therefore has an acceleration
			- Acceleration is proportional to the displacement of the block
			- Direction of the acceleration is opposite direction of displacement from eqb
		- An object moves with *simple harmonic motion* whenever its acceleration is proportional to its position and is oppositely directed to displacement from equilibrium
		- Acceleration is **not** constant
			- Therefore, the kinematic equations cannot be applied
			- If block is released from some
	- Simple Harmonic Motion
		- $$x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$$
			- $A$ is amplitude of motion, the maximum position of the particle in either direction
			- $\omega$ is the angular frequency $$\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
			- $\phi$ is the phase constant or the initial phase angle
		- $A$ and $\phi$ are determined uniquely by the position and velocity of the particle at $t = 0$
		- The phase of the motion is its quantity
		- The frequency/period only depend on the mass of the particle and force constant of the spring
		- SHM is one dimensional
		- The total mechanical is constant and proportional to the square of amplitude
	- Simple Pendulum
		- A simple pendulum exhibits periodic motion
		- Motion occurs in the vertical plane and is driven by gravitational force
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-03-14 14-42-00.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-03-14_14-42-00_1710441761480_0.png)
			  id:: 65f344e3-e5b5-483d-8391-3ff53d425618
			- When $\theta$ is small, a simple pendulum motion can be modeled as SHM about equilibrium
		- The tangential component of gravitational force is restoring force
		- The function $\theta$ is written as $\theta = \theta - \cos( \omega t + \phi)$
		- Frequency and period only depend on lenght and $a_g$
		- All simple pendula of **equal length** and are at the same oscillate with **same period**
	- Physical Pendulum
		- If a hanging object oscillates about a fixed axis that does not pass through $C.O.M.$ and the object cannot be approximated as a particle, is the system of a **physical pendulum**

	- Torsional Pendulum
	- Damped Oscillations
	- Types of Damping
	- Forced Ocillations
		- It is possible to compensate for loss of energy in a damped system by applying an external force
		- Amplitude of motion remains constant if the energy input per cycle exactly equals the decrease in mechanical energy in each cycle that results from resistive forces
		- After sufficient period of time, when the energy input per cycle from the driving force equals the amount of the mechanical energy transformed to internal energy
		- Forced oscillator vibrates at the frequency of the driving force
		- The amplitude is constant as it being driven by an external force
		- The dramatic increase in amplitude near the natural frequency is called **resonance**, and the natural frequency is called **resonance** and the natural frequency is called the **resonance frequency** of the system
	- Resonance
		- The applied force is in phase witht he velocity and the power transferred to the oscillator is a maximum
		- Applied force and $v$ are both proportional to $\sin(\omega t + \phi)$
	- ### Equations
