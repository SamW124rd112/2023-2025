	- ^^**Definition:**^^
		- If $k+1$ objects or more are stored into $k$ boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects
		- ^^**Proof**^^
			- #### Proof by Contradiction:

			- Let  $x \in \mathbb{R}$, then $\lceil x \rceil < x +1$

	- ### Generalized Pigeonhole Principle
		- If $N$ are stored in $k$ boxes, then at least one box contains at least $[N/K]$ objects
		- $\lceil x \rceil$ is the ceiling function: $\lceil x \rceil= \text{min}\{n \in \mathbb{Z} | x \le n\}$
			- Ex. $\lceil 2 \rceil = 2 \qquad \lceil 2.3 \qquad \rceil = 3 \lceil -2.3 \rceil = -2$
		- ^^**Proof**^^

	- ### Consequence of GPP
		- Let $k$ and $r$ be positive integers and suppose some objects are to be placed into $k$ boxes
		- What is the minimum number $N$ of objects that we need to place into $k$ boxes in order to guarantee that at least one box contains at least $r$ objects?
