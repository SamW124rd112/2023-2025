	- Software system design is n abstract activity
		- No procedure
			- Routine, function, method
- **UML** Diagram
- ## What is a variable?
	- A variable is a place in memory, to hold a **value**, which we refer with help of a **label**
	- ```
	  byte i = 33;
	  ```
	- Java is **strongly typed** programming language
	- Each variable has a known size and time at compile time
	- Variable type **must** be declared
	- ```
	  int i;
	  i = 33
	  ```
	- ### What are data types for?
		- It tells the compiler how much memory to allocate:
			- ```
			  double formula; //8 bytes
			  char c; //2 bytes
			  ```
		- Gives information about the **semantic** (meaning) of the data, which operations are allows and compatible data
		- ```
		  c = flag * formula;
		  ```
		- The following statements produce an error during compiling, useful in detecting errors
- ## Data Types in Java
	- In Java, we have primitive and reference data types:
		- Primitive are:
			- Numbers, characters(but not Strings) and booleans
			- **The value is sorted at the memory location designated by the label of the variable**
		- References are:
			- Predefined:
				- Arrays
				- Strings
			- User defined, reference to an instance of a class
		- If it is not primitive, then it is a reference data type
			- The value  of a reference variable is a memory location, which points/references to the location of an object, a **pointer** is a "link" to a reference
