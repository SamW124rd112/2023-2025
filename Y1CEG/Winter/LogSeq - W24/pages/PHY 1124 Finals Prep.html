                <li>Basis of Special Relativity:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>laws of physics are the same</b> in all inertia reference frames</li>
                    <li>The <b>speed of light is constant</b> (in vacuum) in all inertail reference frames is
                        approximately equal to <span>$c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{m/s}$</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Inertial reference frames</b> are systems of coordinates that move with a constant speed relative
                    to each toher, but do not accelerate with respect to each other</li>
                <li>In special relativity, every event is represented in <span>$4$</span>-dimensional <b>spacetime</b>
                    as <span>$(x,y,z,t)$</span>, where <span>$x,y$</span> and <span>$z$</span> are the spatial
                    coordinates and show the point at which this event happens, and <span>$t$</span> is time at which it
                    happens</li>
                <li>All 4 coordinates are measured from an arbitrary "origin" at which they're all zero</li>
                <li>Consider an shown by <span>$(x,y,z,t)$</span> in frame <span>$K$</span></li>
                <li>The coordinates <span>$(x',y'z',t')$</span> describes the same event in another frame
                    <span>$K'$</span> which is moving along the <span>$x$</span>-axis with a constant speed
                    <span>$v$</span> relative to <span>$K$</span></li>
                <li>The <b>Lorentz Transformation</b>:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>$$t' = \gamma \Big( t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\Big)$$</span></li>
                    <li><span>$$x' = \gamma(x-vt)$$</span></li>
                    <li><span>$$y' = y \quad z'=z$$</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Where <span>$\gamma$</span> is defined as:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Gamma is also called the <b>dilation factor</b>, and since <span>$v < c$</span> always we have
                            <span>$\gamma > 1$</span></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the speed <span>$v$</span> is very small, <span>$\gamma$</span> is close to 1</li>
                    <li>As speed <span>$v$</span> approaches the speed of light, <span>$\gamma$</span> approaches
                        infinity</li>

            <li><b>Time Dilation and Length Contraction</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The time between two events in not the same in inertial reference frames are moving with respect to
                    each other</li>
                <li>Clocks run slower in a moving frame compared to a stationary frame, the way to measure the two
                    events:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>$$\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \gamma \Delta t_0$$</span></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>where <span>$\Delta t_0$</span> is the time interval between the two events in the rest
                            frame, callled <b>proper time</b></li>
                        <li>Since <span>$\gamma > 1$</span>, the time interval in the moving frame is greater than
                            proper time (time dilation)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>Length is also relative, and the length of a moving object seen from an inertial reference frame at
                    rest is:</li>

                    <li><span>$$l = l_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \frac{l_0}{\gamma}$$</span></li>
                    <li>where <span>$l_0$</span> is the length of the object at rest, is called the <b>proper length</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>Since <span>$\gamma > 1$</span>, the length in the moving frame is smaller than proper length
                        (length contradiction)</li>

                <li>The <b>velocity</b> of the object with respect to <span>$K$</span> reference frame is called

            <li>The binding energy is given by <b>mass defect</b>, <span>$\Delta m$</span> which is the difference

            <ul>
                <li>The mass defect is always <b>positive</b>: a system of seperated nucleans always has a greater mass
