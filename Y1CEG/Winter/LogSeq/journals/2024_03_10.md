	- ### What is Nanotechnology
		- Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale to produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises  scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer  products, energy, materials, and manufacturing
		- Nanotechnology refers to  engineered structures, devices, and systems. Nanomaterials have a 
		  length scale between 1 and 100 nanometers.
		- Nanomaterials are substances that are, or have been, reduced in size to the range from 1 nm to ~ 100 nm (i.e. 1 to ~ 100 nanometers, or 1 to ~ 100 × 10-9 meters). ***Nanotechnology***
		   is the science and applications of nano-materials, and is growing at an
		   ever increasing pace. At this particle size the properties of materials
		   can be altered dramatically
		- Properties such as solubility, 
		  reactivity, spectroscopy, electrical and magnetic, transport through 
		  membranes etc. are generally different from those of the same materials 
		  with large particle size.

			- Globally, nearly two billion people use either unimproved drinking-water
			   sources or improved sources that are faecally-contaminated. Close to 
			  half a million diarrhoeal deaths in low- and middle-income countries are
			   attributed to inadequate drinking-water, and the vast majority of these
			   deaths occur among children under 5.

			- Conventional Methods
				- Coagulation/flocculation
					- Combining finer particles to make it easier for them to seperated
					- Pros
						- Uptake of the pollutants and separation of the
						  products formed
						- Significant reduction in the chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand
						- Interesting reduction in total organic carbon and adsorbable organic halogen (pulp and paper industry)
						- Bacterial inactivation capability
					- Cons
						- Low removable of arsenic
						- Requires use of non-resuable chemicals (coagulants, flocculants, aid chemicals)
				- Precipation
				- Filtration
					- Pros
						- Carbon has global elimination properties
						- Activated Carbon: efficient for chemical oxygen demand removal; highly efficient treatment when coupled to coagulation to reduce suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and color
						- Sand: efficient for turbidity and suspended solids removal
						- Wide variety of target contaminants
					- Cons
						- Relatively high investment (CAC)
						- Cost of materials (CAC, CAA)
						- Nondestructive processes, non-selective methods
						- Performance depends on the type of material (CAC)
						- Requirement for several types of adsorbents
						- Chemical derivatization to improve their adsorption capacity
						- Rapid saturation and clogging of the reactors (regeneration costly)
						- Not efficient with certain types of dyestuffs and some metals (CAC)
						- Elimination of the adsorbent (requires incineration, regeneration or replacement of the material)
						- Regeneration is expensive and results in loss of material (CAC)
			- Chemical Oxidation
				- Pros
					- Simple, rapid and efficient process
					- Quality of the outflow (effective destruction of the pollutants and efficient reduction in color)
					- Good elimination of color and odor (ozone)
					- Efficient treatment for cyanide and sulfide removal
					- Increases biodegradibility of product
				- Cons
					- Release of volatile compounds and aromatic amines
					- Production, transport and management of the oxidants
					- Short half-life

						- Simple, rapid and efficient, even at high concentrations
						- Produces a high-quality-treated effluent
						- No chemicals required
						- Low solid waste generation
						- Eliminates all types of dyes, salts and mineral

						- Possible to be metal selective
						- A wide range of real applications: clarification or sterile filtration (MF), separation of polymers (UF), multivalent ions (NF), salts from polymer solutions (dialysis) and nonionic solutes (ED), desalination and production of pure water (reverse osmosis)
						- Well-known separation mechanisms: size- exclusion (NF, UF, MF), solubility/diffusivity (reverse osmosis, pervaporation), charge (electrodialysis)

		- Nanomaterials are typically defiend as materials smaller than 100nm in atleast one dimension
		- Drawback of **Carbon Nanotubes**
			- Its low absorbption affiinty for low molecular wieght polar combounds, resulting in unneccessary molecular bonding processes
			- CNT are not a good replaceement for activated carbon as a wide-spectrum adsorbent, it is better to tuned to target specific compounds as it has the ability to remove recalcitrant compounds
		- Metal-based nanoabsorbers are effective low cost absorbenbts for heavy metals and radionuclides
			- Two step process: fast adsorption of metail ions on the external surface followed by rate-limiting intraparticle diffusion along micropore walls
			- Their nanoscale counterparts have higher adsorption capacity and faster kinetics because of the higher specific surface area, shorter  intraparticle diffusion distance and larger number of surface reaction sites (i.e., corners, edges, vacancies)
			- The smaller the nano-magentite particle, the absorption of arsenic drastically increases
			- It also has superparamegnetic properties
		- Membarnes are  physical bariers for stopping constituents based of their size
			- They are easy to reuse, provide a high-level of automation and require less land and chemical use and allow for a fleximble design
			- The inherit drawback is the need to choose between membrane selectivity and permeability
		- ##### Barriers and Research needs
			- Large scale testing of certain nanotechnologies is required, as their long-term efficacy is still unknown
			- The other is cost, as it is extremely expensive
				- One solution is to use low-purity nanomaterials without siginficant comprise to efeeciency, as large cost is involved in the materials seperation and purificaton
				- Nanotechnology based solutions are difficult to implement in developed companies with carefully designed system for long lasting use
				- Places without existing infrastructure are good places to potentially use nanotechnology-enabled treatment processes
