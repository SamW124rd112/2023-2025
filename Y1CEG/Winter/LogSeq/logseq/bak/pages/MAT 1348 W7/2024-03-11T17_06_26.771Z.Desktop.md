			- Prove that it is an equivalence relation
			- Show $R$ is reflexive
			- Show $R$ is symmetric
			- Show $RS is transitive
			- Is $R$ antisymmetric?
	- ### 4.4 Counting Relations
		- Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets
		- Determine the number of relations from $A$ to $B$
		- Example:

			- How many relations are there on $A = {1,2}$
	- ### 4.5 Representing Relations
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Let $R$ be the following relation on $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$
				- $$R =\{(1,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,4)]\}$$
			- Give a visual representation of this relation
			- Is this relation reflexive?
			- Is this relation symmetric
			- Is this relation antisymmetric
		- We can represent a relation $R$ on a small set the following way:
			- Each element of the set is represented by a vertex
			- If $(x,y) \in R$ we can draw an arrow from vertex $x$ to the vertex $y$
			- We can determine the properties of $R$ based on its visual representation
				- $R$ is **reflexive** if and only if there is a loop at each vertex
				- $R$ is **symmetric** if and only if whenever there is an arrow from one vertex to another, there is an arrow in the opposite direction
				- $R$ is **antisymmetric** if and only if whenever there is an arrow from vertex to another, there is no arrow in the opposite direction
				- $R$ is **transitive** if and only if any two-step path can be done in one step
		- Example:
			- Visually represent the following relations on $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
				- $$\{(1,1),(1,5),(2,2),(2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,4), (4,2),(4,3), (5,5), (5,1)\}$$
				- Is it an equivalence relation?
	- ### 4.6 Equivalence Classes
		- ^^**Definition**^^
			- Let $R$ be an equivalence relation of $A$, and let $a \in A$
			- Then the **equivalence class** of $a$ is
				- $$[a]_R = \{x \in A| aRx\}$$
			- $[a]_R$ is the set of all elements of $A$ that are in relation with $a$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Consider the following equivalence relation of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
					- $$\{(1,1),(1,5), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,4), (4,2), (4,3), (5,5), (5,1)\}$$
				- Determine all equivalence classes
				- Consider the following propositions
					- $$P_1: x \rightarrow y, P_2: x \vee y, P_3: \neg(\neg x \vee y), P_4: \neg x \vee y \\ P_5: \neg (x \rightarrow y), P_6: x \oplus y, P_7: x \wedge y, P_8: \neg(x \leftrightarrow y) $$
				- Consider the equivalence relation $\equiv$ on the set of the 8 propositions above
				- Determine the equivalence classes
	- ### 4.7 Modular Arithmetic
		- ^^**Definition**^^
			- Let $a$ be an integer and $m$ be a positive integer
			- We define $a$ mod $m$ to be remainder to be the division of $a$ by $m$
				- $a$ mod $m$ is the integer $r$ such that $a  = qm + r$ where $0 \le r < m$
			- The integer $m$ is called the **modulus**, we say two integers $a$ and $b$ are **congruent modulo** $m$ $a$ mod $m$ and $b$ mod $m$ are equal
				- $a \equiv b$ mod $m$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Compute $a$ mod $4$ for each element of the set
					- $$A = \{-100, 10, -4, -3,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 11\}$$
					- $\equiv$ mod $4$ is an equivalence relation
					- Determine the equivalence classes of $A$
		- ^^**Theorem**^^
			- Let $a$ and $b$ be two integers and let $m$ be a positive integer
			- Then $a \equiv b$ mod $m$ if and only if $m$ divides $a-b$
			- We can use the previous theorem to show that $\equiv$ mod $m$ is an equivalence relation
			- **Reflexive:**
			- **Symmetric:** Suppose $x \equiv y$ mod $m$
				- Show that $y \equiv x$ mod $m$
			- **Transitive:** Suppose $x \equiv y$ mod $m$ and $y \equiv z$ mod $m$
				- Show that $x \equiv z$ mod $m$
			- The equivalence classes of $\equiv$ mod $m$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ are
				- $$[0] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}| x \equiv 0 \text{ mod } m\} \\ [1] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}| x \equiv 1 \text{ mod } m\} \\ ... \\ [m-1] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}| x \equiv m-1 \text{ mod } m\} $$
			- Every integer belongs to one of those $m$ equivalence classes
			- Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on $A$
			- Let $P_1, P_2,..., P_m$ be the equivalence classes
				- Then $P_i \cap P_j = \emptyset$ wherever $i \ne j$
			- Each element of $A$ belongs to one equivalence
				- $P_i \ne \emptyset$ for all $i$
	- ### 4.8 Partition
		- ^^**Definition**^^
			- A **partition** of a set $A$ is a set $P = \{P_1, P_2, ...\}$ of subsets $P_i \subseteq A$ such that
				- $P_i \ne \emptyset$ for all $i$
				- $A = P_1 \cup P_2 \cup...$
				- $P_i \cap P_j = \emptyset$ if $i \ne j$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Let $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$
				- Determine if the following sets are partitions of $A$
					- $P_1 = \{\{3,4,1\}, \{2\}, \{5\}\}$
					- $P_2 = \{\{3,4\}, \{5\}, \{2\}\}$
					- $P_3 = \{\{3,4,1\}, \{1,2\}, \{5\}\}$
				- The following are partitions of $\mathbb{Z}$
					- $$\{\mathbb{Z}^+, \{0\}, \mathbb{Z}^-\} \\ \{\{0\}, \{-1,1\}, \{-2,2\}, ...\} \\ \{\{..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...\}, \{..., -3, -1, 1, 3, ...\}\}$$
		- ^^**Theorem**^^
			- Let $A$ be a set
				- If $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$, then the set of equivalence classes of $R$ is a partition of $A$
				- If $P = \{P_1, P_2, ...\}$ is a partition of $A$, then the relation $R$ on $A$ defined as follows is an equivalence relation:
					- $(a,b) \in R \leftrightarrow \{a,b\} \subseteq P_i$ for some $P_i \in P$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Determine the equivalence relation corresponding to each of the following partitions of $\mathbb{Z}$
					- $\{\mathbb{Z}^+, \{0\}, \mathbb{Z}^-\}$
					- $\{\{0\}, \{-1,1\}, \{-2, 2\}, ...\}$
					- $\{\{..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...\}, \{..., -3, -1, 1, 3, ...\}\}$
				- Consider the following partition of $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$:
					- $$\{\{1,2,4\}, \{3\}, \{5\}\}$$
					- Determine the corresponding equivalence relation on $A$

	- ### 5.1 Definitions
		- ^^**Definition:**^^
			- Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets
			- A **function** $f$ from $A$ to $B$ to an assignment of an element of $B$ to each element of $A$
			- We write $f(a) = b$ if $b$ is the single element of $B$ attributed to the element $a$ of $A$ by the function $f$
			- We write $f: A \rightarrow B$ to indicate $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$
			- $A$ is the **domain** of the function, $B$ is the **codomain**
			- For all $a \in A$, $f(a) is the **image** of $a$
			- $f(A) = \{f(a) | a \in A\}$ is the **range** of the function
			- For each $b \in B$, we define $f^{-1} (b) = \{a \in A | f(a) = b\}$
			- This set is the **preimage** of $b$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Let $X = \{1,2,3\}$ and $Y = \{p,q,r,s\}$
				- Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be defined as follows:
					- $$f(1) = p, f(2) = p, f(3) = r$$
				- Visually represent this function from $X$ to $Y$
				- Determine why the following diagrams do not represent functions
			- We often define functions based on rules
				- $$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \qquad  f(x) = x^2$$
				- $$f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow Q \qquad f(m,n) = \frac{m}{n}$$
				- $$f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \qquad f(x,y) = x-y$$
				- $$f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow Z \qquad f(a,b) = a + b$$
				- $$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \qquad f(x) = 2$$
	- ### 5.2 Injective Function
		- ^^**Definition:**^^
			- A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is **injective** if for all $x,y \in A$, the following implication is true:
				- $$[f(x) = f(y)] \rightarrow [x=y]$$
			- A function is injective if every element of $B$ is attributed to at most one element from the domain $A$ by the function
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Visually represent an injective function and a non-injective function from $A = \{a,b,c\}$ to $B = \{1,2,3\}$
				- Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \qquad f(x) = x^2$. Is $f$ injective?
				- Let $g : \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \qquad g(x) = x^2$. Is $g$ injective?
				- Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets such that $|A| = 4$ and $|B| = 3$
			- **Theorem:** If there exists an injective function $f: A \rightarrow B$, then $|A| \le |B|$
	- ### 5.3 Surjective Function
		- ^^**Definition**^^
			- A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is **surjective** if for all $b \in B$, there exists at least one $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$
			- A function is surjective if every element of the codomain is the the image of some element of some element of the domain
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Visually represent a surjective and non-surjective function from $A = \{a,b,c\}$ to $B = \{1,2,3\}$
			- Let $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ be defined as $f(x,y) = (2x,y). Is $f$ surjective?
			- Let $g: \mathbb{Z}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^2$ be defined as $g(x,y) = (2x, y)$. If $g$ surjective
			- Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets such that $|A|= 3$ and $|B| = 4$. Find a surjective function from $A$ to $B$
		- **Theorem:** If there exists a surjective function $f: A \rightarrow B$, then $|B| \le |A|$
	- ### 5.4 Bijective Functions
		- ^^**Definition**^^
			- A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective
			- If there exists a bijective function $f: A \rightarrow B$, then $|A| = |B|$
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Show the function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \qquad f(x) = 4x+1$ is bijective
			- We first show $f$ is injective: suppose $f(x) = f(y)$. We show $x = y$
			- We now show $f$ is surjective: let $y \in \mathbb{R}$ (the codomain). Find $x \in \mathbb{R}$ (the domain) such that $f(x) = y$
		- For finite sets, if $f: A \rightarrow B$ is bijective, then $|A| = |B|$
		- For infinite sets, we compare their cardinalilities using bijective functions
	- ### 5.5 Composition of Functions
		- ^^**Definition:**^^
			- Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$ be two functions
			- The **compostion** of $g$ and $f$ denoted $g \circ f$ is defined by
				- $$(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)), a \in A$$
			- The function $g \circ f$ is from $A$ to $C$ (from the domain of $f$ to the codomain of $g$)
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Let $A = \{0,1,2,3,4\}, B = \{p,q,r,s\}$ and $C = \{i,j,k\}$
			- Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$ be the following functions. Determine $g \circ f$
		- For the composition $f \circ g$ to be well defined, the range of $g$ must be subset of the domain of $f$
		- Example:
		  background-color:: blue
			- Let $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the following functions
				- $f(x) = 5x -7 \qquad g(x) = x^2$
			- Find $g \circ f$ and $f \circ g$
	- ### 5.6 Inverse
		- ^^**Definition**^^
			- Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a set
			- The **identity function** on $A$, denoted $id_A$ is the function $id_A: A \rightarrow A$ defined as
				- $id_A (x) = x$  for all $x$ in A
			- The function $id_A$ is bijective
		- ^^**Definition**^^
			- Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a function
			- The **inverse function** of $f$ if it exists, is the function $f^{-1}: B \rightarrow A$ such that
				- $f^{-1} \circ f = id_A$ and $f \circ f^{-1} = id_B$
			- The inverse function is such that for all $a \in A$ and for all $b \in A$
				- $f_{-1}(b) = a$ if and only if $f(a) = b$
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Find the inverse function of $f(x) = 4x+1$
		- Notes on the inverse:
			- Not all functions have an inverse
			- If $f: A \rightarrow B$ has an inverse, then $f$ is called **invertible**
			- If $f$ is invertible, then its inverse function is unique
			- If $f$ is invertible, then its inverse $f^{-1}$ is also invertible, and the inverse of $f^{-1}$ is $f$
			- A function $f$ is invertible if and only if it is bijective
