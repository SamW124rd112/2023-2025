- Supersecure runs the physical security of businesses using security guards. Each business client signs a
- contract with Supersecure to secure certain rooms in certain buildings. Each contract has a start date and
- an end date.
-
- There will be different security plans for working hours and non-working hours. The client might require
- no guards or fewer guards during non-working hours. The schedule for which hours are working hours is
- determined by the client.
-
- In a security plan, one or more guards is assigned to patrol each zone. A zone is a group of rooms. There
- are  also  certain  spots  called  ‘posts’  where  there  must  be  at  least  one  guard;  i.e.  posts  cannot  be  left
- unguarded. A post is always in a particular room, which is identified by a room number. Some zones have
- to have more than one guard, and certain zones require high levels of security clearance for the guards that
- work there. The number of guards needs to be captured by the system.
-
- Supersecure hires guards and assigns them to shifts to  meet the contractual requirements of clients.  A
- guard can be assigned to different shifts. A guard can work on a part-time or full-time basis. A shift can
- be assigned to several guards. Supersecure needs to record the posting of a single guard to a single shift.
-
- Each guard has to log incidents that happen during their shift. A log entry includes the room, the time, a
- description, and the guards involved
