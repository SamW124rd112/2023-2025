	- ## Logic Functions
		- Logic function is the behaviour of a logic diagram
		- $$z_i = F_i (x_0, x_1, x_2, ...) | z_i \in \{0,1\}, i = 0,1,2, ...., m-1, x_k \in \{0,1\}, k =0,1,2, ..., n-1$$ where
		- $F_i =$ logic functions, $x_k =$ input variables, $z_i=$ output variables
		- **Logic function** $F$ can be ^^represented^^ by

		- ### Approximations of **Real** Time-Diagrams
			- **Propogation Delay**
				- Propagation delay is the amount of time required for a signal to be received after it has been sent, and the actual output is not instantaneously changed

			- **Rise Time/Fall Time**
				- Also referred to as slope or slew rate trigger, which measures the time the signal takes to transition between two voltage thresholds: from a lower threshold to an upper threshold, in rise time, or the **opposite** in fall time

	- ## Boolean Algebra
		- ### Boolean Algebra over Boolean Vectors
		- ### Boolean Algebra Axioms
		- ### Boolean Algebra Fundamental Theorems
	- ## Logic Functions Representations
		- ### 1. Truth Tables
			- The unique signature of a Boolean Function
			- Many alternative gate realizations have the same truth table
		- ### 2. Logic (Boolean) Expressions
		- ### 3. Digital Logic Gates
		- ### 4. Karnaugh Maps
			- Graphical representation of a truth table of a logic function
			- Each line in the truth table(minterm) corresponds to a square in the Karnaugh Maps
			- Karnaugh map squares are labelled so that horizontally or vertically **adjacent squares** differ by only one variable
