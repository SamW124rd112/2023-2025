	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Software is intangible
			- Hard to understand development effort
		- ### Software is easy to reproduce
			- Main cost is **development**, whereas in other engineering disciplines, manufacturing is the costly component of production
		- ### The industry is labour intensive
			- Hard to automate
		- ### Untrained people can still put something together
			- Quality problems are hard to notice
		- ### Software is easy to modfiy
			- People make changes without fully understanding it
		- ### Software is long lasting, and does not "wear out"
			- It "deteriorates" by having its design changed erroneously or in unanticipated ways, increasing complexity
	- ## Some Times of Software
	  id:: 66daf451-44d7-418f-bd23-cae72c27f52a
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Real time embedded software

	- ## What is Software Engineering?
	  id:: 66daf451-6c2c-44ed-ba97-d3561bfc9b9d
	  collapsed:: true
		- The process of ^^solving customers' problems^^ by the systematic development and evolution of large, high-quality software systems within cost, time and other constraints
		- ### Solving customers' problems
			- The goal
			- Sometimes the solution is to **buy**, not ^^build^^
			- Adding unnecessary features often makes software worse
			- Software engineers must *communicate effectively* to identify and understand the problem
		- ### ^^Systematic development^^ and evolution
			- An engineering process involves applying *well understood techniques* in an organized and disciplined way
			- Many well-accepted practices have been formally standardized by the IEEE or ISO
			- Most development work is **evolution**
		- ### Large, high quality software systems
			- Software engineering techniques are needed because large systems cannot be completely understood by one person
			- Teamwork and coordination are required
			- Dividing up the work and ensuring that parts of the system work properly together is a key challenge
			- The end product must be of sufficient quality
		- ### Cost, time and other resources
			- Finite resources
			- Benefit must outweigh the cost
			- Others are competing to the do the job cheaper and faster
			- Inaccurate estimates of cost and time have historically caused many project failures
	- ## The Software Engineering Profession
	  id:: 66daf451-77f3-4afd-9026-f1cbbe704ba5
	  collapsed:: true
		- The term "Software Engineering" was coined in 1968, as people began to realize the principles of engineering can apply to software development
		- #### Engineering is a licensed profession
			- In order to protect the public
			- Ethical practice is also a key tenet of the profession
	- ## Software Engineering Code of Ethics
	  id:: 66daf640-5bf0-4c07-9314-df4f0445f305
	  collapsed:: true

	- ## Software Quality
	  id:: 66db1d71-e478-47ce-968a-4359b9241686
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Usability
			- Users can learn it fast and get their job done
			- UI is a pivotal component in streamlining usability
		- ### Efficiency
			- Doesn't  waste system resources such as CPU or memory
		- ### Reliability
			- Does what is required without failing
		- ### Maintainability
			- Can be easily changed
		- ### Reusability
			- Parts of the code can be reused in other  projects, so reprogramming is not needed
	- ## Stakeholders in Software Engineering
	  id:: 66db1ce4-963e-4f5b-b941-d92fe1c871a1
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### Users
			- Those who use the system
			- Always need an advocate for users on the software team
			- Software should be easy to learn, efficient to use and helps get the work done
		- ### Customers
			- Those that pay for the system
			- Software should solve their problems at an acceptable cost in terms of the money spent & resources used
		- ### Developers
			- Those that develop the system
			- Software should be easy to design, maintain, and reuse
		- ### Managers
			- Those that supervise the production of the system
			- Software should be able to sell, pleasing customers while costing less to develop and maintain
		- ^^All of these roles can be played by the same person^^
	- ## Software Quality Conflicts and Objectives
	  id:: 66db1e91-0be5-403b-a05e-2e84dcc357aa
	  collapsed:: true
		- ### The different qualities can conflict
			- Increasing efficiency can reduce maintainability or reusability
			- Increasing usability can reduce efficiency
		- ### Setting objectives for quality is a key engineering activity
			- Design to meet objectives, which avoids "over-engineering" which wastes money
	- ## Software Engineering Projects
	  id:: 66db1fc4-9185-4b4a-b281-3c26f8f5d33f
	  collapsed:: true
		- Most projects are **evolutionary** or **maintenance** projects, involving work on ^^legacy systems^^:
			- **^^Corrective^^ projects:** fixing defects
			- **^^Adaptive^^ projects:** changing the system to fit OS, database, rules and regulations
			- **^^Enhancement^^ projects:** adding new features for users
			- **^^Reengineering (Perfective)^^ projects:** changing the system internally so it is more maintainable
		- **^^"Green Field"^^ projects**
			- New development, and very rare projects

- ## [[Object Orientation and Java]] #[[SEG 2105]]
	- ## What is Object Orientation
		- ### Procedural paradigm
			- Software is organized around the notion of *procedures*
			- **Procedural abstraction**
				- Works as long as the data is simple
		- **Adding *data abstractions* group together pieces of data that describe some entity**
			- Helps reduce the system's complexity
				- Such as *records* and *structures*
		- ### Object oriented paradigm
			- Organizing procedural abstractions in the context of data abstractions
	- ## Object Oriented Paradigm
		- All computations are performed in the context of objects
			- The objects are instances of classes which:
				- Are data abstractions
				- Contain procedural abstractions that operate on the objects
			- A running program can be seen as a collection of objects collaborating to perform a given task
		- ![Screenshot from 2024-09-10 15-21-19.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-09-10_15-21-19_1725996262355_0.png) A view of the two paradigms
	- ## Classes and Objects
		- ### Object
			- A chunk of structured data in a running software system
			- Has *properties*, represents its state
			- Has *behaviour*, how is acts and reacts
				- May simulate the behaviour of an object in the real world
			- **Objects as a UML Instance Diagram**
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-09-10 15-26-26.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-09-10_15-26-26_1725996413433_0.png)
		- ### Class
			- A unit of abstraction in an object oriented (OO) program
			- Represents similar objects
				- Its **instances**
			- A kind of software module
				- Describes it instances' structure (properties)
				- Contains *methods* to implement their behaviour
		- ### Classes vs. Instances
			- Something should be a *class* if it could have instances
			- Something should be an *instance* if it is clearly a ^^single member^^ of the set defined by a class
			- Example:
			  background-color:: blue
				- Film; class, instances are individual films
				- Reel of film; class; instances are physical reels
				- Film reel with serial number SW19876; instance of reel
				- Science fiction; instance of class genre
				- Science fiction film; class; instance includes '*Star Wars*'
				- Showing '*Star Wars*' in the '*Phoenix Cinema*' at '*7pm*'; instances of film showing
		- ### Naming Classes
			- Use *capital letters*(ex. `BankAccount` not `bankAccount`)
			- Use *singular nouns*
			- Use the right level of generality
			- Make sure the name has only one meaning
