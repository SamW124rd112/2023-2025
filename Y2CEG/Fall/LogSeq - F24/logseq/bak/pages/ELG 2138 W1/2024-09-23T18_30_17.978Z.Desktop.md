	- ## Independent Sources of Electricity
		- These are sources that generate power in the circuit and they come in two basic sources
		- ### Independent Current Sources
			- A device that guarantees that a prescribed amount of current flows from one terminal to the other
			- ![Screenshot from 2024-09-22 16-55-27.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-09-22_16-55-27_1727038556619_0.png)
			- This current source guarantees that 10 amps will come out of terminal B
		- ### Independent Voltage Sources
			- A device (ex. battery) that guarantees that its terminals are different in potential with a prescribed value

	- ## Resistors
		- A resistor limits are regulates the flow of electrical current in a circuit, impeding and resisting the flow of electric charges
		- Resistance can be calculated using **Ohm's Law**
			- $$i = \frac{v}{R}$$
			- And all of its forms
		- ### Reading Resistor Values
			- Each colour represents a number
			- First three colours represent a value, the last represents the tolerance
				- First 2 colours are numbers, then multiplier then tolerance
	- ## Waveforms of Sources of Electricity
		- Sources can generate a prescribed **constant** amount of electrical phenomena, however there are source that generate a **variable** electrical phenomena
		- Two kinds of electrical sources:
			- ### Constant
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-09-22 17-06-23.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-09-22_17-06-23_1727039253037_0.png)
				- $v(t) =\text{Constant}$
			- ### Sinusoidal
				- ![Screenshot from 2024-09-22 17-08-33.png](../assets/Screenshot_from_2024-09-22_17-08-33_1727039348843_0.png)
				- $v(t) = V_p \cos (\omega t + \theta)$ where,
					- $V_p$ is amplitude, defining the maximum and minimum
					- $\omega$ is frequency, how many cycles/$s$
					- $T$ is period, length of one cycle is $s$
						- $T = 2\pi / \omega$
					- $\theta$ is phase angle,the shift in the starting of the sinusoidal waveform, measured in degrees
