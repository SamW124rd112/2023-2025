# [[Circuit Theorems]] #[[ELG 2138]]
	- ## Source Transformations
		- Circuit theorems are used to simplify analysis
		- **Source equivalence** is used to substitute voltage sources for current sources and vice-versa

	- ## Superposition Principles
		- The principle states that **if** the circuit is composed of ^^linear elements^^ and ^^voltage and current^^ sources only, then:
			- The value of any current or any voltage can be obtained by **adding** the values obtained from due each **independent source** alone, while **deactivating the other sources**
			- **^^Therefore,^^** we can find any electrical quantity such as the current in any resistor **through** find the current due to each source individually while **deactivating** the other sources
		- ### Basic Steps of Superposition Principle:
			- Deactivate all **independent sources** (voltage and current) and leave one source only
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- To deactivate an **independent current** source, replace with ^^open^^ circuit
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- To deactivate an **independent voltage** source, replace with ^^short^^ circuit
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Perform circuit analysis on the resulting circuit
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Record the values of currents or voltages of interest
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Repeat the above steps for all other sources that were inactive last time
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Add the values obtained from each time
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
