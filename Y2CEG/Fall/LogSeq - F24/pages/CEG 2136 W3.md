	- ## Number Systems
		- There are four main types of number systems:
			- Binary
			- Octal
			- Hexadecimal
			- Decimal
		- In general, a number system of **base** or **radix** $r$ is a system that uses distinct symbols for $r$ digits that uses distinct symbols for $r$ digits
		- A number $x$ in base $r$, noted as $(x)r$ has the general form:
			- $$(x)_r = x_n x_{n-1} ... x_1 x_0 \cdot x_{-1} x_{-2}...x_{-m}$$ where $x \in \{0,1,..., r-1\}$ and $\in \{n, n-1, ..., -m\}$
		- To convert number from **base** $r$ to **decimal base**(radix 10), the formula:
			- $(x)_r = (x_n \times r^n + x_{n-1} \times r^{n-1} + ... + x_0 \times r^0 + x_{-1} \times r^{-1} + ...+ x_{-m} \times r^{-m} ) 10$
		- ### Binary Number System
			- The **binary system** uses the radix 2
				- Uses two binary bits
		- ### Octal Number System
			- The **octal system** uses radix 8
				- The eight symbols of the octal system are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7
		- ### Hexadecimal Number Sytem
			- The **hexadecimal system** uses radix 16
				- The 16 symbols of the octal system are 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E and F
				- The symbols A,B,C,D,E and F correspond to 10,11,12,13,14 and 15 respectively
		- The most-significant bit (MSB) is the leftmost bit of a number
		- The least-significant bit (LSB) is the rightmost bit of a number
		- ### Conversion
			- Converting a decimal number to its equivalent representation in radix $r$ is carried out by separating the numbers into integers and fraction pats
				- Convert each part seperately
			- The ^^conversion of the decimal integer^^ into base $r$ representation is done by **successive divisions by** $r$ and accumulation of the remainders
			- The ^^conversion of decimal fraction^^ into radix $r$ representation is done by **successive multiplcations by** $r$ and accumulating the integer digits so obtained
		- ### Binary Number Representations
			- In computer systems, binary numbers are represented as unsigned or signed numbers
				- **Unsigned** numbers are always assumed to be non-negative
				- **Signed** numbers can be either non-negative or negative
			- The sign of a signed numbered is determined by the value of a pre-specified bit, known as the **sign bit**, in the number's representation
			- The sign bit is usually taken to be the left-most bit in the number's representation
			- The common convention in a binary system is that the sign bit is 0 for a non-negative number and 1 for a negative number
	- ## Complements
		- Complements are used in digital computers for simplifying the subtraction operation and for logical manipulation
		- There are two types of complements for each base $r$ system
			- ### ($r-1$)'s Complement (Diminished Radix Complement)
				- Given a number $N$ in base $r$ with $n$ digits, the ($r-1$)'s complement of $N$ is defined as $[(r^n-1)-N]_r$
				  id:: 671015f3-b902-4ac6-ab50-f2e38027ecd1
				- The $(r-1)$'s complement of a number may also be derived by subtracting each digit from (r-1)
			- ### $r$'s Complement
				- The $r$'s complement of an $n$-digit number $N$ in base $r$ is defined by
					- $(r^n - N)_r$ if $N  \ne 0$
					- $0$ if $N= 0$
				- The $r$'s complement can also be computed by adding 1 to the $(r-1)$'s complement
				- Another way of computing the $r$'s complement is by leaving all least significant 0's unchanged, subtract the first non-zero least significant digit from $r$, and then subtracting all higher significant digits from ($r-1$)
